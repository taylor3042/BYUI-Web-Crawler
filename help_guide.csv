If it is a windows device, the employee just need to leave the computer, power supply, and docking station with their department secretary who will take care of the device from there. If it is an apple device however, the device needs to be removed from the employee's apple account before it is left with their secretary. Below are the steps on how to remove the device. This applies for all Apple devices (Mac computers, tablets etc).    Removing the Apple Device     1. Go to System Settings on the device you want to remove from your Apple account.    2. Click ""Apple ID"" (name at the top).    3. Scroll to the bottom and click ""Sign Out.""        4. If you would like to keep a copy of your data, click ""Keep a Copy"" in the window that pops up. If you don't want to keep a copy, uncheck all the boxes and click ""Continue.""        5. Once you are signed out of the device, simply leave it with your department secretary. They will take care of the process of returning the device to IT (or getting it wiped for the next employee) from there.         If for any reason the above process doesn't work, there is another way to remove the device, as outlined below. If this is being done from a phone/tablet instead of a computer, open the Find My app and skip to step 5.    1. Go to iCloud.com and click Sign In        2. Sign in using your personal Apple ID        3. You will be taken to your account page. In the section of apps, click and open ""Find My""        4.

Some errors and error messages you may encounter while using Microsoft Outlook include the following messages:    “Cannot send this item” or “The destination email address is unrecognized”    This error message typically deals with how an outgoing email message has been formatted. Check the To: field of the message first to ensure that the recipients address is correct.    This error can also occur when there is a problem within HTML-based email messages. Try changing the outbound message’s format to plain text or rich text should resolve this. Visit Microsoft Support to find out how to change the message format.         “No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it”, “The server could not be found”, or “Error 0x800CCC0F”    First make sure that your computer still has an active network connection. To do this, click your computer’s wireless icon to see which Wi-Fi network – if any – it is connected to.    If you have verified that you are connected to a network and are still experiencing issues with Outlook, make sure that there are no permissions issues interrupting your ability to send emails.    Occasionally, a blocked firewall port or over-aggressive antivirus software can cause this error. Try unblocking the firewall port or scaling back your antivirus’s protections (at least temporarily).     If you have fixed any problems with your connectivity, firewall, or antivirus and are still having problems, delete and recreate your Outlook profile.         Emails won't send    If you are having difficulty sending and/or receiving emails from your BYU-Idaho account, it is probably because a pop-up blocker on your computer is preventing this from happening. How you can disable the pop-up blocker varies depending on your Internet browser.    Google Chrome    1. Open Google Chrome.    2. Go to the Chrome menu and select Settings.        3. Select Show Advanced Settings at the bottom of the page.    4. Under Privacy, select Site Settings.        5.

This does not mean there are two separate emails to keep track of.    As shown in the image above, a user's email is sometimes displayed as a BYU-Idaho email (smithj347@byui.edu) and a username@byui.edu email (johnsmith@byui.edu). Both email addresses are attached to the same profile. An email sent to smithj347@byui.edu will go to the same inbox as one sent to johnsmith@byui.edu.         Which email should I use to log into a Microsoft application?    When users input their email address, Microsoft is only looking for the BYU-Idaho domain name of ""@byui.edu"". This lets Microsoft know that a BYU-Idaho user is wanting to log into their school account.        Once the user inputs the email, Microsoft will then open the BYU-Idaho login page, as shown below. Users will then input their username and password to log in. This will take the user to their individual profile.        Ultimately, it does not matter which email to use. Microsoft is mainly looking for the BYU-Idaho domain name. But if you are still not sure, here are troubleshooting options that may help:    1. Read the prompt, they should tell you which one to use. Look for phrases like ""email address"" or ""username"".    2. Always try your school email first if instructions are not clear. Your school email is the abc18001@byui.edu email, not username@byui.edu.    3. Use your username@byui.edu if your school email does not work.    4. Microsoft should take you to the BYU-Idaho login page if you are not already logged into your BYU-Idaho account.    5. Contact the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through the Live Chat function if you continue to have problems.         What is the difference between my BYU-Idaho username and my Outlook email?    A username and an email have very similar functions. Both take you to your personal profile.    This can be similar to a person having both a name and a nickname. Benjamin could easily also be called Ben or Bennie. Each of those names are used to refer to the same person.    This is similar to a user's account at BYU-Idaho. Microsoft Outlook simply has two different emails attached to the same profile. Again, having two emails is nothing to be concerned about."

To learn how to add a Zoom meeting to any Outlook Calendar event, see the Zoom for Outlook article.         How much bandwidth is required for Zoom?    Zoom has certain bandwidth requirements for audio and video calls. See the article System Requirements for PC, Mac, and Linux.         What if I want to record a Zoom meeting and post is as a video?         What computer should I use if I’m working from home?    The following questions should help you determine the right path forward:         What data can I store or access on personal devices?    As an employee at BYU-Idaho, you can save files to Microsoft OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams. It is recommended you save all your work to one of these products. However, saving personal files to these platforms is not supported by the I.T. department.    Saving files to Microsoft OneDrive, SharePoint, and/or Teams will automatically back up your files and allow you to share them with others. You should never store any sensitive BYU-Idaho data or files on your personal device.    See the following links for additional resources on how to use these products:         Can I take monitors or other equipment home with me?    With your direct supervisor’s approval, you can take your monitor, keyboard, mouse, and/or docking station home with your campus-issued laptop.         What if I need a web camera?    If you require a web camera for working from home, you should work with your department to acquire one through approved purchasing methods (i.e. Amazon).         How can I access on-campus systems (Jenzabar, iSeries, etc.) from home?    Certain applications are protected via campus firewalls and are only accessible on campus. A virtual private network (VPN) connection is required to access these from off campus. You can request VPN access by submitting a request at VPN Request or by contacting the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through the Live Chat bubble.    The BYU-Idaho VPN is provided by redundant appliances with a theoretical capacity of 5000 users. Cisco has indicated they will temporarily provide additional free licenses as needed. While the system should scale to many more users, only those who need access to on-campus systems should request VPN access.         What if I’m working from home and I need to use my desk phone?    You may forward your desk phone to a home phone or cell phone by pressing the Forward all button on your desk phone and entering the number you wish to forward calls to.    You may also use the Cisco Jabber application on your laptop or other device, like you would your desk phone. You can learn how to setup Cisco Jabber on your device by visiting the Setting Up Jabber article.    Cisco Jabber can turn any computer or cell phone into a BYU-Idaho softphone and is available for up to 1500 concurrent users. To request this capability, contact the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through the Live Chat bubble.         What is G Suite?    G Suite is a set of online productivity tools provided by Google. You can use G Suite for Education as an additional option to collaborate and share documents and files, and connect with others at BYU-Idaho through messaging and video conferencing.

We are adding this security measure to help keep your personal information as safe as possible. Even if someone else knows your username and password, they will not be able to get into your account unless they also have the device that you use to authenticate.     Check out the article Why Do We Need 2-Factor Authentication? for more information.         How often will I need to authenticate?    Each authentication lasts for 30 days. That means that unless you’ve recently cleared your history or cache, you’re using a new Internet browser, or you’re using Incognito mode, you will only have to go through the process every 30 days per device.      EXAMPLE: If you authenticated from your computer in Google Chrome, you would be authenticated for your computer and Google Chrome for 30 days. However, if you tried to access your BYU-Idaho account from the same computer later in the day, but used Safari instead of Google Chrome, you would need to authenticate again. You would then be authenticated for your home computer, for both Google Chrome and Safari, for 30 days. Within those 30 days, you would only need to authenticate again if you used a new device (e.g., a library computer) or another new browser.      Let’s say that 15 days later, you cleared your cache after I-Learn maintenance. You would then need to authenticate again, and the 30-day period would restart.         How do I set up 2-Factor Authentication?    For instructions on how to set up your Duo Mobile 2FA, visit our article Updated DUO Mobile Help Guide.         When will 2-Factor Authentication be implemented for me?    Certain groups of students will receive authorization to begin setting up Duo Mobile accounts starting March 24, 2020. You will receive an email if you are included in one of these groups. A new group of students will be added every Tuesday until all students have been added to Duo Mobile. We hope to reach the completion of the project by June 2020. After that, every new student will join Duo Mobile upon registration at BYU-Idaho.         Will I need to authenticate from the Testing Center?    No. We recognize that you will not be able to bring any authentication devices with you into the Testing Center, and so authentication in the Testing Center will not be required.           What if I get an authentication notice when I’m not trying to log in to my account?    This means that someone is trying to get into your account. Deny the login request, and immediately change your BYU-Idaho password.         Will I need to authenticate when using an on-campus network?    Yes. However, you will not need to authenticate when using a work computer that is “wired,” or plugged in, to an Internet connection. For example, if you were using a work computer during your shift you would not need to authenticate. However, when you left work, went to class, and started using your personal computer in class, you would need to authenticate if you had not authenticated for that computer and browser in the last 30 days."
https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=11644&SIDs=290,Why Do We Need 2-Factor Authentication?,Log-In Authentication 2fa 2-factor-authentication duo duo-mobile access-account duo-access why-do-we-need-2fa protect duo-2fa,"To understand why we need 2-Factor Authentication (2FA), we first need to understand what 2FA is helping to protect.     Why do we need 2FA?    The rationale behind this is simple but powerful: requiring 2FA for students to log in better protects student information. Unfortunately, we live in a world where more and more people can access your private information and use it for going places they shouldn't (like your bank account). Because your account information can be accessed from both on-campus and off, we protect it more than our other on-campus systems. With 2FA, we are able to add an extra step to that process which makes it easier for you to keep track of who, when, and even where someone logs in to your account. Since the authentication process is linked to your phone, you alone give permission for someone to log in to your account to be accessed. If you have lost your phone or got a new one, check out the article I Lost My Phone, or I Got a New Phone.    If you're worried authenticating is going to be a crazy complicated process, don't be. Simply log in to your BYU-Idaho account and follow the prompts to authenticate into your account. So don't freak out. By using 2FA, you are responsibly safeguarding your account.

Read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) below.    Why is 2FA being implemented?    We are adding this security measure to help keep your personal information as safe as possible. Even if someone else knows your username and password, they will not be able to get into your account unless they also have the device that you use to authenticate.      Check out the article Why Do We Need 2-Factor Authentication? for more information.         How often will I need to authenticate?    Each authentication lasts for about 14 days if you select 'Yes this is my device'. That means that unless you’ve recently cleared your history or cache, you’re using a new Internet browser, or you’re using Incognito mode, you will only have to go through the process every 14 days per device.    Let’s say that 10 days later, you cleared your history. You would then need to authenticate again, and the 14-day period would restart.         How do I set up 2FA?    To see the step-by-step tutorial on how to set up Duo Mobile 2FA, visit our article How to Set Up 2-Factor Authentication with Duo Mobile.         What methods are available for me to authenticate with if I don’t have a mobile phone as my second authentication device?    Authentication Methods include:    Note: SMS and phone call passcodes will no longer be available    If a phone was left at home or lost, a call to the help desk can give you a temporary bypass code for a few days until the phone is recovered. For users that need exceptions, we will have some alternate MFA options available such as a Yubi key or Duo Hardware token, depending on the situation. These users should work with their supervisor for approval.     If you do not have a smartphone, we strongly recommend using the push notification option to a device capable of downloading the Duo Mobile app. Not only is this option quicker, easier, and can be used offline, it also doesn't cost any money to the school for messaging and data rates.          Could I use a security key with DUO?    You can get an authentication token by contacting the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through the Chat bubble. A token will cost a one-time fee of $30 but will supply passcodes on an as-needed basis for as long as 2FA is utilized at BYU-Idaho (in other words, for the foreseeable future). You can also purchase a security key. See our Security Keys and DUO tech guide for more information.          Will I need to authenticate from my classroom or office?    Yes. By request of the CES SOC, BYU-Idaho will be changing the security model for all on-campus devices. This new model will require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all resources that use SSO (Canvas, BYUI Portal, Workday, etc...). This new model will be similar to the experience of accessing BYU-Idaho SSO authenticated resources off campus. The use of Duo will be required.          What if I get an authentication notice when I’m not trying to log in to my account?    This means that someone is trying to get into your account. Deny the login request, and immediately change your BYU-Idaho password."

We are adding this security measure to help keep your personal information as safe as possible. Even if someone else knows your username and password, they will not be able to get into your account unless they also have the device that you use to authenticate.     Check out the article Why Do We Need 2-Factor Authentication? for more information.         How often will I need to authenticate?    Each authentication lasts for 30 days. That means that unless you’ve recently cleared your history or cache, you’re using a new Internet browser, or you’re using Incognito mode, you will only have to go through the process every 30 days per device.      EXAMPLE: If you authenticated from your computer in Google Chrome, you would be authenticated for your computer and Google Chrome for 30 days. However, if you tried to access your BYU-Idaho account from the same computer later in the day, but used Safari instead of Google Chrome, you would need to authenticate again. You would then be authenticated for your home computer, for both Google Chrome and Safari, for 30 days. Within those 30 days, you would only need to authenticate again if you used a new device (e.g., a library computer) or another new browser.      Let’s say that 15 days later, you cleared your cache after I-Learn maintenance. You would then need to authenticate again, and the 30-day period would restart.         How do I set up 2-Factor Authentication?    For instructions on how to set up your Duo Mobile 2FA, visit our article Updated DUO Mobile Help Guide.         When will 2-Factor Authentication be implemented for me?    Certain groups of students will receive authorization to begin setting up Duo Mobile accounts starting March 24, 2020. You will receive an email if you are included in one of these groups. A new group of students will be added every Tuesday until all students have been added to Duo Mobile. We hope to reach the completion of the project by June 2020. After that, every new student will join Duo Mobile upon registration at BYU-Idaho.         Will I need to authenticate from the Testing Center?    No. We recognize that you will not be able to bring any authentication devices with you into the Testing Center, and so authentication in the Testing Center will not be required.           What if I get an authentication notice when I’m not trying to log in to my account?    This means that someone is trying to get into your account. Deny the login request, and immediately change your BYU-Idaho password.         Will I need to authenticate when using an on-campus network?    Yes. However, you will not need to authenticate when using a work computer that is “wired,” or plugged in, to an Internet connection. For example, if you were using a work computer during your shift you would not need to authenticate. However, when you left work, went to class, and started using your personal computer in class, you would need to authenticate if you had not authenticated for that computer and browser in the last 30 days."

The rationale behind this is simple but powerful: requiring 2FA for students to log in better protects student information. Unfortunately, we live in a world where more and more people can access your private information and use it for going places they shouldn't (like your bank account). Because your account information can be accessed from both on-campus and off, we protect it more than our other on-campus systems. With 2FA, we are able to add an extra step to that process which makes it easier for you to keep track of who, when, and even where someone logs in to your account. Since the authentication process is linked to your phone, you alone give permission for someone to log in to your account to be accessed. If you have lost your phone or got a new one, check out the article I Lost My Phone, or I Got a New Phone.    If you're worried authenticating is going to be a crazy complicated process, don't be. Simply log in to your BYU-Idaho account and follow the prompts to authenticate into your account. So don't freak out. By using 2FA, you are responsibly safeguarding your account.

With help from Apple and Android, you can now add a Passkey to your Duo account in order to authenticate. Passkeys are similar to Security keys (which you can learn more about in this Help Guide) but the key is stored on your phone instead of an external device. Duo will label these as Passkey instead of Security Keys.     You can use a passkey to authenticate with Duo even when you are offline, as long as you have your phone. It is also a great substitute if you can't get the Duo app or texts or phone calls. However, the Passkey feature is only available on newer devices. On iPhone, you must have a phone with iOS 16 or later, and Android 9 or later is required for Android Phones.

For more information, reference this article from Duo: https://duo.com/blog/what-are-passkeys    How to add a Passkey    1. Go to the duo authentication page and click ""Other Options""        2. From the list of other options, select ""Mangage Devices""        3. Verify your identity using your preferred method        4.

But, these devices must meet the WebAuthn/FIDO2 security protocol (please see DUO's security requirements documentation for more information). Devices that do not meet this protocol are not supported and cannot be used with DUO.    These security keys are a safe, reliable option for 2-factor authentication. However, we strongly advise users to be familiar with the setup, configuration, and daily operation of these devices, before making the decision to purchase them. Since there are a wide variety of different brands and models, we cannot make specific device or brand recommendations. Due to the wide variety of brands, models, and specifications BYU-I support personnel cannot troubleshoot or resolve issues arising while using or operating these devices. We highly recommend contacting the manufacturer since they can offer the specific support required for the correct make and model.     Requirements    The following criteria must be met to use security keys with a BYU-I DUO account:    For more requirements, please visit DUO's security requirements documentation.     What are security keys?    To put it simply, a security key is a physical device that can be used as another form of 2-factor authentication. Security keys are a promising trend in cyber security which seeks to add more security and resistance to phishing attacks. And for a tech-savvy user, security keys can also add a layer of convenience, since it offers the speed of taping on a USB device already plugged into your computer. By design, security keys are physical devices that are plugged into a USB port on your computer. The small USB device then acts as your 2nd form of authentication with just a tap on the device when prompted by DUO. In a lot of cases, this might be a better solution for users wishing to have fewer required apps on their smartphones and/or for international users that may not have access to a smartphone. In most cases, users should opt for free, more user-friendly options, such as using DUO mobile push notifications.    DUO makes security keys an option for organizations and BYU-Idaho has elected to allow users to add security keys to their accounts. As with all authentication services, such as usernames and passwords, these security keys should be kept safe, protected, and out of reach of those with unauthorized access. Please keep these devices in a safe location. If you lose your security key, remove it from your DUO account as soon as possible, so the security of your BYUI account remains uncompromised.    Please note: if you are someone easily frustrated by technology, security keys may not be a good option. Security keys are not always a cheap option; prices can range from $19 to $100+. Replacing lost security keys requires purchasing a new key, removing the old device from your DUO account, and adding the replacement. If you DO choose to use a security key, we highly recommend buying at least two (with one as a backup) and having another authentication method enabled on your account (such as DUO Mobile, SMS, etc.). Doing so will prevent you from inadvertently being locked out of your account in the unfortunate situation of a lost key.     Here are just a few examples of available security keys:     How to configure with DUO    You must have the device in hand and ready to be plugged into your computer. Adding the security key is quick and easy. Follow these steps:    Important: security keys can only be added by the user. Due to the inherent nature of these devices, namely all security keys are physical hardware devices and must be plugged into the user's device to be configured, the IT Service Desk is limited in how they can help. If you chose to use such a device, please note that you assume all responsibility and the required self-service.    For information on how to add and use security keys on your DUO account, please visit the DUO help guide DUO Universal Prompt guide for step-by-step instructions.    How to use security keys    Using a security key for DUO is fairly simple. Once you've configured your account to use the security key(s), you'll see ""Security key"" as an option on your screen whenever you're prompted to use Duo. When you select ""Security key"" simply follow the on-screen prompts—it's easy.

But, these devices must meet the WebAuthn/FIDO2 security protocol (please see DUO's security requirements documentation for more information). Devices that do not meet this protocol are not supported and cannot be used with DUO.    These security keys are a safe, reliable option for 2-factor authentication. However, we strongly advise users to be familiar with the setup, configuration, and daily operation of these devices, before making the decision to purchase them. Since there are a wide variety of different brands and models, we cannot make specific device or brand recommendations. Due to the wide variety of brands, models, and specifications BYU-I support personnel cannot troubleshoot or resolve issues arising while using or operating these devices. We highly recommend contacting the manufacturer since they can offer the specific support required for the correct make and model.     Requirements    The following criteria must be met to use security keys with a BYU-I DUO account:    For more requirements, please visit DUO's security requirements documentation.     What are security keys?    To put it simply, a security key is a physical device that can be used as another form of 2-factor authentication. Security keys are a promising trend in cyber security which seeks to add more security and resistance to phishing attacks. And for a tech-savvy user, security keys can also add a layer of convenience, since it offers the speed of taping on a USB device already plugged into your computer. By design, security keys are physical devices that are plugged into a USB port on your computer. The small USB device then acts as your 2nd form of authentication with just a tap on the device when prompted by DUO. In a lot of cases, this might be a better solution for users wishing to have fewer required apps on their smartphones and/or for international users that may not have access to a smartphone. In most cases, users should opt for free, more user-friendly options, such as using DUO mobile push notifications.    DUO makes security keys an option for organizations and BYU-Idaho has elected to allow users to add security keys to their accounts. As with all authentication services, such as usernames and passwords, these security keys should be kept safe, protected, and out of reach of those with unauthorized access. Please keep these devices in a safe location. If you lose your security key, remove it from your DUO account as soon as possible, so the security of your BYUI account remains uncompromised.    Please note: if you are someone easily frustrated by technology, security keys may not be a good option. Security keys are not always a cheap option; prices can range from $19 to $100+. Replacing lost security keys requires purchasing a new key, removing the old device from your DUO account, and adding the replacement. If you DO choose to use a security key, we highly recommend buying at least two (with one as a backup) and having another authentication method enabled on your account (such as DUO Mobile, SMS, etc.). Doing so will prevent you from inadvertently being locked out of your account in the unfortunate situation of a lost key.     Here are just a few examples of available security keys:     How to configure with DUO    You must have the device in hand and ready to be plugged into your computer. Adding the security key is quick and easy. Follow these steps:    Important: security keys can only be added by the user. Due to the inherent nature of these devices, namely all security keys are physical hardware devices and must be plugged into the user's device to be configured, the IT Service Desk is limited in how they can help. If you chose to use such a device, please note that you assume all responsibility and the required self-service.    For information on how to add and use security keys on your DUO account, please visit the DUO help guide DUO Universal Prompt guide for step-by-step instructions.    How to use security keys    Using a security key for DUO is fairly simple. Once you've configured your account to use the security key(s), you'll see ""Security key"" as an option on your screen whenever you're prompted to use Duo. When you select ""Security key"" simply follow the on-screen prompts—it's easy. If you find yourself still having issues though, feel free to check out Duo's articles at guide.duo.com    Support Information"

However, many people are taking advantage of the increased Zoom traffic by hacking into meetings and ""Zoombombing."" Zoombombing, much like photobombing, is when someone makes their way into a Zoom meeting to which they were not invited. They then drop inappropriate or alarming content into the meeting, often through screen sharing.    In this article, you can learn what steps you can take to protect your meetings from so-called Zoombombers. The steps in the tutorial sections are based on the web browser version of Zoom with modifications for desktop version of Zoom, which can be downloaded here.    Get a new meeting ID    Rather than using your personal meeting ID for each meeting, use a per-meeting URL in your Zoom invitations. Because of the short life span of these per-meeting URLs, this will decrease the likelihood of someone finding your URL in an Internet search and joining uninvited. To learn more about generating a random meeting ID, visit Zoom's support tutorial.         Add a password    In addition to creating a new meeting ID, you may want to create a password. Even if you use a new URL every meeting, a Zoombomber can still find the invite and hop in. Creating a password adds an extra layer of security to your meetings.    
1. Go to byui.zoom.us, and sign in with your BYUI credentials. Click My Zoom Account        2. Click the Schedule a Meeting tab on the right side of the navigation bar on your Zoom home page.        On the desktop version, click the Schedule button in the center of the window.        3. Scroll down until you find the Meeting ID and Security sections.        4. If it is not already selected, change the Meeting ID to Generate Automatically. Then, check the box next to Passcode.        5. A password box will appear. You can either use the code given in the box, or you can create your own. This is the password your participants will use to get into the meeting.        6. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save.    7. Send the meeting link as well as the password in a private message or email to your participants.    Require authentication    By allowing only authenticated users to join, you can weed out anyone who isn't using their school email. Below is how to change the setting for a scheduled meeting.    1. Click the Schedule a Meeting tab and scroll down to the bottom of the page until you reach the Security section.        On the desktop version, click the Schedule button in the center of the window.        2. Under Security, check the boxes next to Waiting room and Require authentication to join.    3. In the drop down menu under Require authentication to join, select one of the following options        4. Click Save.    Require Authentication Default Setting    To make authentication a default setting for all your zoom meetings, follow the steps below.    1. Click on Zoom Settings located on the side bar, and then Meetings at the top.        2. Scroll down to Only authenticated users can join section and toggle it on.        3. Click on Edit next to Only BYUI Employees or Students        4. Check Set as default authentication option and click Save             Create a waiting room    1. Click the Schedule a Meeting tab and scroll down to the bottom of the page until you reach the Security section.        On the desktop version, click the Schedule button in the center of the window.        2. Under Security, check the box next to Waiting room.             Turn off ""Join Before Host""    This default setting allows anyone with access to the meeting to join before the host does. By turning off this feature, you lower the risk of someone joining and broadcasting content to all your meeting attendees without you there to kick out the Zoombomber.     1. Go to Settings then Meeting.        2. Scroll down to Allow participants to join before host and ensure it is toggled off.        In the desktop version, this can be found under the Advanced Options tab in Schedule. Make sure Allow participants to join anytime is unchecked.             Disable screen share    Screen share is a helpful tool that allows others in the meeting to see whatever is on your screen. However, if a Zoombomber is allowed to screen share in your meeting, they could show anything they want to your meeting. Disabling this feature will disable a lot of opportunities for Zoombombers.    You may still need to enable screen share as an option for yourself and your students for certain projects, assignments, or just overall better communication. In the Settings tab, you can configure the screen share settings so that only the host can screen share, and the host can control who else can screen share.    1. Click the Settings tab on the left side of the Zoom home window.        In the desktop version, click the gear icon at the top right corner of the window.        2. Under the Meetings tab, click In Meeting (Basic).        In the desktop version, click the View More Settings button at the bottom of the window. This will take you to the browser version of Zoom.          3. Scroll to Screen sharing, make sure it is turned on with the toggle button, and select Host Only under Who can share?             If someone successfully Zoombombs your meeting    If a Zoombomber does get into your meeting, there are ways to halt them in their tracks.    Kick them out    If there is anyone in your meeting who shouldn't be there, you have the power to make them leave.    1. Open the Participants List.        2. The list will slide out from the left of the screen. Hover over the participant's name and click the More drop-down menu. Click Remove.        3. Click Yes to confirm the removal.        Restrict their access    If you don't want to kick them out, you can simply silence them by stopping their video and audio.    1. Open the Participants List.        2. The list will slide out from the left of the screen. Hover over the participant's name. Click Mute to turn off the participant's audio.        To stop the participant's video, click the drop-down menu and select Stop Video."

If meeting invitees are using Zoom with a school email, they will not be placed in a waiting room. However, if they are using an external email to log into your school Zoom sessions, they will be automatically placed in a waiting room and need to be admitted into the meeting.     Zoom's settings will automatically default to placing attendees using external emails into waiting rooms. This setting can be changed to place all attendees, including those using a BYU-Idaho email, into waiting rooms. See the Combatting Zoombombing article for more information.     These updates are being implemented to increase security within Zoom meetings and ensure the safety of all attendees.  For more information, visit the Zoom Support article on waiting rooms."

How VDIs work    A VDI is a virtual server with dozens of software programs, specifically for BYU-Idaho users. The term virtual in this context means ""to give the appearance of."" In this case, BYU-Idaho's Virtual Desktop Interface is designed to look and act exactly like a personal computer.    To access this computer interface, the user must have BYU-Idaho's VDI link and credentials. For the VDI link, see the article How to Access VDI.    Once the user has logged in, they aren't controlling just their computer anymore, they are also giving commands to the virtual server. Even though this is a virtual server, it displays just like any other computer. The user can access any of the applications provided on the VDI.    If you don't have two monitors, you can move between the VDI screen and your personal computer screen by selecting the tabs on the top of the screen. For those who have two monitors, they will be able to see two different screens, as shown in the image below.    The left image is the BYU-Idaho Server. The right is the user's personal computer.             Why students need this    The VDI has several great uses. Firstly, the VDI is capable of handling big programs that a user's personal computer may not be able to handle, such as Adobe CC, Windows, and various engineering programs. For example, students who have to constantly come to campus to access software can access the same software anywhere in the world by accessing the VDI from a personal computer.    Secondly, the VDI is useful for users who are not able or do not want to download certain software onto their personal computer. Instead, they simply access the VDI to use the programs they need. This is especially useful for users who take classes that require the use of multiple types of obscure software on a frequent basis or for students who need access to a software they know will never use again.    For example, Mac users sometimes have a difficult time installing Windows. Instead of going through the process of downloading Windows onto their Mac, the user would access the VDI. From there, they can use Microsoft Office, Adobe, and other software needed for that semester's classes.    If there is a program/software a student needs for a specific class and the VDI does not have it, the student can contact their professor who can make a request to get the program/software added to VDI. Be aware that not all programs/software can be added to the VDI.         How to log off    Closing the tab does not log the user off. The user stays logged in, which in some cases may cause the user to get locked out of their account when they try to log back in on a different WiFi.

With Yammer, you can easily collaborate with others, communicate quickly and thoroughly, and distribute files. There are even mobile apps for the Yammer platform!    What is Yammer?    One of the big shifts that has taken place in the way people communicate is via social networks. Social networks are becoming a major part of the way businesses work. Yammer is a mature enterprise social network specially designed to help employees stay connected with each other within a company. It has both free and standalone versions, but it gains much more functionality when enabled as part of all Office 365 subscriptions. Social networks inside the enterprise are not something to be feared; they are a new tool that will increase the productivity of all of us and make us feel much more engaged in our work.    Yammer provides a news feed section in the middle of its page where users can post updates and comment on existing posts. It also allows for users to use hashtags to highlight a certain point or use the @ symbol to mention other people in a post and notify them of your postings. Yammer supports the concepts of dedicated groups generally designed to be focused on a certain topic so it doesn't swamp the main feed or annoy those who are not interested in that topic. Access to these groups can be restricted.These groups serve as sub-groups to the overall company news feed.         Why would I use Yammer?    Yammer allows you to:          How is Yammer laid out?    Yammer is very similar to Facebook in its look and feel. New posts - complete with Likes - appear on Yammer's primary screen, which is known as the News feed. Icons indicating private messages and other notifications appear in the upper left-hand corner. You can create groups, which is helpful for segregating talk that is relevant only to specific internal teams. If a group conversation eventually requires assistance from other employees, you can share it with a specific person via instant message or with a whole other group using the Update function.         Why should I use hashtags on Yammer?    Hashtags are very useful on Yammer because they help categorize your posts. Yammers robust search function digs up hashtagged posts quickly, so be sure to slap tags like #[currentyear]projections or #KeyCorporateAccount on the end of your posts for future searches.         Can I contact coworkers on Yammer?    The People Directory automatically creates a searchable database of every person enrolled in your Yammer, making it especially easy to find contact information for the people in your company. Even better, employee profiles come with a Skills section that makes it easier to search for them in the People Directory. You can also create external networks and invite non-employees (suppliers and clients, for instance) to join those networks.         How do I share files on Yammer?    Anyone can attach a file to a post in order to quickly share information without forcing recipients to slog through clogged inboxes. You can also upload files - including images and videos - to a file repository where other Yammer members can download and update them. Groups have their own separate file repositories (that augment the main one) that employees can receive automatic notifications for whenever critical files are updated.         Does Yammer have mobile platforms?    Yammer has apps for iPhone, Android, and the Windows Phone. Compared to traditional email messaging, Yammer offers some unique benefits:"

We all love technology—it's great—until it stops working. This is why the IT Service Desk at BYU-Idaho offers solutions like Zoho Assist to get your issues solved quickly and conveniently, so you can get back to your studies, projects, and work without the frustration. In this article, we explain the what Zoho Assist is and why we use it to support you. We'll also do a brief dive into how we respect your privacy and security along the way. If you still have questions after reading this article, please don't hesitate to contact us!     What is Zoho Assist?    Zoho Assist is a private and secure remote support that allows our service desk analysts to instantly view and access your computer or device through screen-sharing in real-time. Whether you're facing a software glitch, seeing strange error codes, need help with an installation, or require guidance on using a particular service, Zoho Assist enables us to resolve your issues without the need for a physical visit. This feature is particularly helpful when supporting students with technical issues that live outside of the Rexburg area, especially our students who live overseas.     Why Use Zoho Assist?    When searching for a the right remote support tool, we found many benefits of using Zoho Assist: faster resolution, added convenience, greater access to expert assistance, and a ""Zero Footprint"" on your device.     Faster Resolution    The tool allows for real-time screen sharing, making it easier for our technicians to diagnose and resolve issues promptly. This means less downtime for you and a more efficient use of your time.     Added Convenience    You don't have to disconnect your machine and bring it to a service center. Support is provided right where you are, making the entire process convenient and hassle-free.    Expert Assistance    Our technicians are well-trained and experienced, ensuring that you receive the highest quality of service. With Zoho Assist, they have a full suite of tools at their disposal to resolve your issues effectively.    Zero Footprint    The term ""Zero Footprint"" refers to the minimalistic approach Zoho Assist takes when it comes to installation and system resource utilization. Unlike traditional remote support tools that require a full-fledged installation, Zoho Assist operates largely through the browser or a small, temporary file. After your session is ended, Zoho Assist is immediately and automatically removed from your device. This means that there's no need to install bulky software, and no residual files are left on your system once the session is terminated.    Zoho's zero footprint model offers easy installation for both you and our technicians. The installation software is quick and lightweight. For technicians, this model simplifies the process of initiating a remote session. There's no need to guide our customers through a complex installation process; a simple link or code is often sufficient.        Privacy & Security    Data Encryption & Security Protocols    We understand that privacy and security are paramount. Zoho Assist employs industry-standard TLS 1.2 and AES 256-bit data encryption to ensure that all remote sessions are secure and safe. Any information collected during the remote support session is encrypted and protected from unauthorized users. All remote support connections require your consent before we can connect to your device. So you have complete control before, during, and after the remote session, in fact Zoho Assist allows you to terminate the screen-sharing session at anytime.     User Consent & Temporary Access    Before initiating a remote session, our technicians will always seek your explicit consent. You'll be able to see all the actions performed during the session for full transparency.    Only authorized BYU-Idaho employees have access to your device and only during the session that you have approved. Each session requires a unique session ID (a secure code that an agent shares with you, that Zoho generates), which then expires at the end of the session, this gives our employees temporary access only to your device. In fact, once the remote support session ends, the software is automatically deleted off your device, through Zoho Assist's ""Zero Footprint"" protocol.    Multi-Factor Authentication    Session Recording & Compliance    Feel free to view more information about Zoho Assist by visiting their website at www.zoho.com/assist/instant-remote-support.

Some errors and error messages you may encounter while using Microsoft Outlook include the following messages:    “Cannot send this item” or “The destination email address is unrecognized”    This error message typically deals with how an outgoing email message has been formatted. Check the To: field of the message first to ensure that the recipients address is correct.    This error can also occur when there is a problem within HTML-based email messages. Try changing the outbound message’s format to plain text or rich text should resolve this. Visit Microsoft Support to find out how to change the message format.         “No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it”, “The server could not be found”, or “Error 0x800CCC0F”    First make sure that your computer still has an active network connection. To do this, click your computer’s wireless icon to see which Wi-Fi network – if any – it is connected to.    If you have verified that you are connected to a network and are still experiencing issues with Outlook, make sure that there are no permissions issues interrupting your ability to send emails.    Occasionally, a blocked firewall port or over-aggressive antivirus software can cause this error. Try unblocking the firewall port or scaling back your antivirus’s protections (at least temporarily).     If you have fixed any problems with your connectivity, firewall, or antivirus and are still having problems, delete and recreate your Outlook profile.         Emails won't send    If you are having difficulty sending and/or receiving emails from your BYU-Idaho account, it is probably because a pop-up blocker on your computer is preventing this from happening.

This does not mean there are two separate emails to keep track of.    As shown in the image above, a user's email is sometimes displayed as a BYU-Idaho email (smithj347@byui.edu) and a username@byui.edu email (johnsmith@byui.edu). Both email addresses are attached to the same profile. An email sent to smithj347@byui.edu will go to the same inbox as one sent to johnsmith@byui.edu.         Which email should I use to log into a Microsoft application?    When users input their email address, Microsoft is only looking for the BYU-Idaho domain name of ""@byui.edu"". This lets Microsoft know that a BYU-Idaho user is wanting to log into their school account.        Once the user inputs the email, Microsoft will then open the BYU-Idaho login page, as shown below. Users will then input their username and password to log in. This will take the user to their individual profile.        Ultimately, it does not matter which email to use. Microsoft is mainly looking for the BYU-Idaho domain name. But if you are still not sure, here are troubleshooting options that may help:    1. Read the prompt, they should tell you which one to use. Look for phrases like ""email address"" or ""username"".    2. Always try your school email first if instructions are not clear. Your school email is the abc18001@byui.edu email, not username@byui.edu.    3. Use your username@byui.edu if your school email does not work.    4. Microsoft should take you to the BYU-Idaho login page if you are not already logged into your BYU-Idaho account.    5. Contact the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through the Live Chat function if you continue to have problems.         What is the difference between my BYU-Idaho username and my Outlook email?    A username and an email have very similar functions. Both take you to your personal profile.    This can be similar to a person having both a name and a nickname. Benjamin could easily also be called Ben or Bennie. Each of those names are used to refer to the same person.    This is similar to a user's account at BYU-Idaho. Microsoft Outlook simply has two different emails attached to the same profile. Again, having two emails is nothing to be concerned about."

As part of the ongoing effort to protect students, faculty, and staff against phishing emails and other cyber attacks, BYU-Idaho has partnered with the Church Educational System Security Operations Center (CESSOC). The CESSOC has a breadth of experience mitigating cyber threats and currently protects several other Church-sponsored institutions.    This article explains the procedure for reporting potential phishing emails to the CESSOC. It is important that the suspect phishing email is attached as an email file instead of forwarded.    Not sure if you've been phished? Check out the article Detecting Phishing.         Preferred Method    Using the ""Report"" Function in Outlook    If you suspected that you have received a phishing email or other scam emails, keep all interactions with the email to a minimum. The best way to report these emails is to use the built-in ""Report"" Function of Microsoft Outlook.     When you preview an email you can select the ""Report"" drop-down menu. Select the ""Report phishing"" option.        After you have reported the email, and if you are worried about your information's security, you should change or reset your password. You can do this process yourself or you can call or chat with the IT Service Desk and they can help you with your password reset.         Alternative Methods    If for whatever reason this process does not work for you you can follow the following instructions based on your way of accessing your school email. You can send the phishing email, as an attachment, to phishing@byui.edu to report the phishing or scam email.         From the Outlook Webapp (accessed through your BYU-Idaho account)    1. Sign into your BYUI account and open the Outlook webapp.        2. In your Outlook inbox, select New Message.        3. After the new message opens, select the Open in a new window button in the top right-hand corner of your new message.        4. After the new window opens, create a split screen between your email inbox and the new window so that both are visible. Address the new email to phishing@byui.edu        5. In your inbox, click and drag the suspect phishing email over to the body text field of your new message draft.         6. You will see the phishing email appear as an attachment in the body of your new message draft.        7. Click Send. There is a Send button at the top and the bottom of the email draft, either one will work.             From the Outlook Desktop App app on PC (installed and accessed on your desktop computer)    1.

Similar to a “hub,” the access point is a common connection point for devices in a wireless network.     Bandwidth: The speed of a network connection commonly reported in Kilobits per second (Kbps) or Megabits per second (Mbps).     Client Adapter: Radio hardware installed in the client device (laptop, PDA, etc) that allows communication to and from an access point.     Connection Quality: Wireless connection quality is determined by factors that can affect radio transmissions, such as distance from the access point, number of users sharing bandwidth, state of the environment in which the transmission is taking place, and the presence of other devices that can cause interference. Acceptable throughput levels should be specified within service level agreements.     Coverage: The geographical area that covers an acceptable level of wireless activity, or the geographical area where good connection service quality is attainable.     Encryption: A method of scrambling and unscrambling data between one connection point to another, with the purpose of preventing unauthorized eyes from deciphering the data.     Interference: Degradation in wireless communications by any number of causes, such as other wireless devices, microwaves, handheld radios, cordless telephones, high voltage audio speakers, etc. Such interference usually slows down a wireless transmission or completely eliminate it depending on the strength of the signal.     User Authentication: A method by which the user of a wireless system can be verified as a legitimate user, independent of the computer or the operating system being used.     Wireless Infrastructure: Wireless access points, antennas, cabling, power, and network hardware associated with the deployment of a wireless communications network."

https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=11761,Types of Viruses,spam virus phishing-scam it-viruses virus-type virus-definition virus-explanation define-adware define-boot define-bug define-direct-action define-directory define-file-infector define-hijacker define-keylogger define-macro define-malware define-overwrite spyware trojan-horse worm,"Adware: Adware is among the most troublesome of computer threats. It can hide in places such as downloads for songs, movies, etc. Once installed on your computer, adware creates a flurry of advertisements and sends them directly to your computer. They can embed even more advertisements within the text of articles.    Direct Action: Direct action viruses begin their work as soon as they are installed on your computer. Typically, direct action viruses are designed to immediately activate/replicate when someone performs a specific action on a computer.    Directory: As its name would suggest, a directory virus attacks your computer by infiltrating its directory. (In computer terminology, a directory is just any big computer file that contains several smaller sub-files.) Typically, it will infect files with .EXE for PC's or .DMG for Mac extensions. Invisible to the user, a directory virus changes the host file so that the virus activates with the host file.    File Infector: File infectors are a classic virus; when someone refers to a generic virus, they are probably discussing these. These viruses spread from program to program by seeking out files to infect and then copying code into those files. Eventually, if left unchecked, file infectors can take over an entire system by compromising all of its files.    Hijacker: Hijacker viruses alter your Internet browser settings, typically in order to force your browser to redirect you to a page specified by the virus. These redirect pages are usually designed to advertise a product or drum up publicity for something/someone. They also alter the home page of your browser, spam you with unwanted advertisements, and block you from viewing Internet content.    Keylogger: Keyloggers place hidden software on your computer. This software keeps track of your keystrokes and takes note of the passwords you enter. Depending on what accounts you have, this can give hackers access to all kinds of private information.    Macro: Macro viruses contaminate individual programs on your computer. When a macro virus infects a program, it triggers a series of actions that will happen whenever someone runs the program.    Malware: Malware is any computer code that is designed to infiltrate a computer and damage it or its content.    Phishing Scam: Phishing occurs when you receive an email from a seemingly legitimate source asking for personal information like your Social Security Number or credit card number. Legitimate companies will never solicit this kind of information via email. If you receive an email asking for this information, delete the email immediately and report it to the IT Service Desk. This is one of the most prevalent techniques used by hackers to steal your information, money, or data. Always be vigilant for spam messages.     Ransomware: One of the most devastating or alarming forms of an attack. Bad actors can literally steal the data belonging to you on your device, work or school account, and hold is ransom from you. Most times, the ransom must be paid in a form of money (gift cards, Venmo, or Paypal). Good cyber practices can protect you from ransomware. Most modern antivirus programs will offer you protection against ransomware. And these antivirus companies are spending time and energy to find ways to better protect against evolving ransomware attacks.     Spam: The term ""spam"" refers to emails sent with the intent of advertising something or getting you to click a link. At their best, spam emails are simply nuisances that clutter your inbox, and they can be dealt with by dragging-and-dropping the message into the recycle bin. At their worst, they can promote illegal products/activities or conceal malware.    Spyware: Spyware is a form of malware that spies on your computer use. Spyware can take screen shots, capture data such as passwords and usernames, and collect other personal information. Keyloggers are just one example of spyware.    Trojan Horse: A Trojan horse is a virus that hides inside of something to make itself look enticing and appealing.    Virus: A virus is a type of malware that is designed to replicate and spread.    Worm: A worm is a form of virus that can copy itself and spread from computer to computer. It is not downloaded or attached to any one program; rather, it tunnels through computer networks in order to spread.    Check out the articles Antivirus Software Tips and Mac Viruses & Tips."

The ideal frequency for password-changing is every six months. When someone has your BYU-Idaho password, they have access to all your BYU-Idaho-associated records, including registration details, graduation progress, grades, email, and financial information. Some of this information can be destructive if it falls into the wrong hands.      A quick and easy way to prevent information theft is to change your password frequently. This keeps potential thieves and criminals guessing, which keeps your information safe. However, while it’s smart to change your passwords frequently, do not change them too often. Changing passwords too frequently can result in weaker passwords that are easier for criminals to guess, which negates the security benefits offered by frequent password changes.           How do I retrieve my forgotten username/password?    If you have forgotten your password, visit the  Forgot Username or Password page. Be prepared to provide your Social Security Number (or 999 number if you are an international student), your last name, and your date of birth.         How do I get a BYU-Idaho username or password for a new student or alumni?    New students    If you have been accepted to BYU-Idaho, but do not have a username or password yet, verify that you have accepted your admittance offer by visiting the response page. When the page loads, enter your CES NetID and password, and then follow the instructions on the next page.    Alumni    1. Go to www.byui.edu, and click the Sign In button.        2. Select Create username and enter your personal information.        3. Follow the prompts to create a username and password and select Next.        4. Close out of your browser, then wait one hour for the system to update.     What if I get an error message when I try to log in after changing my password?    This could mean that your password change has not activated yet. Accounts usually take a minimum of one hour to activate. We ask you to be patient. If you have waited an hour or longer, contact the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through the Live Chat bubble.    What should I do if my account is locked/disabled? Why is it locked?    There may be a number of reasons your account may be locked:    If you have more than 10 failed attempts in a row, you will receive the following error message, ""Your account has been locked out due to excessive authentication failures.""    Solution: Wait 5 minutes and your account will automatically be unlocked unless further failed attempts occur. If this doesn't resolve this issue, please contact the IT Service Desk.     The most common causes of locked accounts are unresolved student holds, such as student health center holds (TB test), unresolved debt, continuing endorsements, etc. For issues with holds from the Student Health Center, please contact the Student Health Center at 208-496-9330. For problems with other holds, please see our Resolve Holds webpage.    What if I do not have a security question on file or do not remember the answer to my security question?    If you do not have a security question or do not remember the answer to your security question, contact the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-9009 or through the Live Chat bubble for a temporary password reset.    How do I delete passwords from the Mac Keychain?    The Mac password management system is called the Keychain. This system stores all your passwords for applications, servers, and websites. Keychains can also remember sensitive information such as credit card numbers or PINs for bank accounts.      While saving your BYU-Idaho password to your Apple Keychain is convenient, saving this information makes your account susceptible to hackers. It is recommended that you remove your password from the Keychain for your safety.    1. Open Finder.    2. Select Applications.    3. Select Utilities.        4. Select Keychain Access.        5. Type byui into the search bar and press Enter.        6. When a list of search results appears, hold down the Shift key, select the bottom result, and then press Delete.        7.

This will allow the phone to reconnect to the Wi-Fi. Check out the article Forgetting Wi-Fi for more information.    How to update passwords    Visit the article Changing BYU-Idaho Passwords to learn how to update or change your current password.    Updating BYU-Idaho password on several platforms    When you change your BYU-Idaho password, that password will need to be changed on every platform you use that password on. Visit the article Updating BYU-Idaho Password on Several Platforms to learn how to update your password across multiple platforms.         Creating a more secure password    Hacking and password-cracking tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the more personal information we store in online accounts the more important it is to make sure our accounts are secure. The best place to start is with a strong password.     Password requirements    Passwords should be a collection of 12 or more     If your password is an ordinary word or name, a keyboard sequence, all letters, all lowercase, or fewer than 12 characters, you should change it to something stronger. Don't rely on tricky mixes of symbols, numbers, and uppercase letters alone. A mix of symbols, numbers, and uppercase letters makes a password stronger, but that alone wont make a simple password strong. For example, LetM3in isn't much better than just letmein when it comes to security.    Remember your password with a phrase    To keep it simple, stick with a word or phrase you know and remember. Add symbols or numbers in place of letters where it might make sense to you, but not to others. The key here is to stay away from commonly used words or phrases, and to stay above 12 characters. Excellent passwords are long and complex, but easy to remember. Ideally, you are not using the same password for multiple websites, so you will want to remember your passwords and keep them straight.     Strong passwords can also be created by stringing unrelated words together in a way that's memorable to you because it’s humorous (Inevitable culinary cat freedom, correct horse battery staple, etc.). While the entire phrase is long enough to be used as an effective password, a mix of numbers and symbols adds an extra layer of security.     Examples of strong passwords    How secure is my password?    Check out this website to see how secure different kinds of passwords are. Just input a fake password and the website will tell you how long it will take hackers to crack your password. For best results try a different combination of letters, numbers, symbols, and length. You may be surprised at the results!    How Secure Is My Password?         Security questions    1.

People use them for all kinds of things phone calls, texting, email, Web browsing, shopping, and more. Unfortunately, the rise in people using mobile devices for innocent purposes means there are now more people using them for criminal purposes.    Mobile worms    Mobile worms work very similar to computer worms. Rather than being transferred via downloads or infected USB drives, mobile worms spread by “tunneling” from one phone to another using wireless networks. They usually bury themselves within text messages or voicemails. The purpose of these worms is to manipulate your phone in ways that hike up your phone bill.     With the proper precautions you can protect yourself and your device. These precautions include:          Vulnerable applications    Vulnerable applications are apps which require your personal information to operate, but do not encrypt (secure) that information properly. This leaves a lot of potential for identity theft and other crimes.         Lost or stolen devices    Beside the immediate and obvious frustration of missing an important and expensive electronic, a lost or stolen phone or tablet can cause an enormous security risk. Depending on who falls into possession of the device, your information could be compromised.     Prevention is better than a cure. Set a passcode on your phone. Locked phones are less attractive to thieves than unlocked ones. If your phone goes missing, the passcode will serve as an extra layer of protection for your information. Make sure your password is somewhat complicated, avoiding common codes like 1234 or 0000.     If you suspect your phone or tablet has been lost or stolen:"

Printing directly from your browser    Whenever you print directly from the Internet, the printing job results are not guaranteed to look as expected. Printing directly from the Internet can cause inconsistent results due to web developers using different methods to keep their pages updated. If these pages are not updated properly, it can cause documents to print blank or as a collection of random characters. If it is vital that your printed document looks the same as it does on the screen, it is highly recommended that you convert the document to a .pdf rather than attempt to print it directly from the Internet.         Opening a document instead of saving    When you Open a document in the web browser rather than Save it to your computer, computer-to-printer issues often result. This is because the document may not register as fully downloaded, which can sometimes cause inconsistencies with the printer. These inconsistencies usually cause the printer to print blank pages.     To resolve this issue, download the document in question and save it as a .pdf before printing.         Paper jam on campus    If the jam is easily visible and can be removed quickly and effortlessly, feel free to remove the jammed paper yourself by taking hold of it and slowly pulling it from the printer.      If you cannot see where the jam has occurred, or do not feel comfortable fixing the jam on your own, you can submit a ticket to I.T. and someone will come help you. You can also contact the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through the Live Chat bubble.         Poor print quality    If your printer is printing documents too lightly, make sure that the printer you are using is stocked with the appropriate paper for your print job. You may have to locate a printer that can correctly print your job.     It is also possible that the printer is low on toner or ink. Check the screen on the printer for a notification. To get help replacing the cartridges, you can submit a ticket to I.T. and someone will come help you. You can also contact the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through the Live Chat bubble         Printer took my money but didn't print    Check your Pharos account. If the print job is still uploaded to Pharos, it may be an issue with Pharos not releasing it. If the print job released from Pharos but nothing printed, then it is likely an issue with the printer.    If it's likely an issue with your Pharos account, contact the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through their Live Chat function.    If it's likely an issue with the printer, try another printer on campus and let the I.T. Service Desk know that that printer is having issues.    You can make a request for Printer Support through this form.         Printer out of paper    To request more paper for this printer, contact the I.T. Service Desk at (208) 496-1411 or through their Live Chat function. They will be able to service the printer.         Print job failed to print    If you you try to print a document and nothing happens or you get an error that the document could not be printed, follow the steps below.    Word and Powerpoint files    A Tip for more successful printing of Word (doc or docx files) and PowerPoint (pptx) files:      While the print system can print Word and PowerPoint files, the content embedded in a Word or PowerPoint file (especially PowerPoint files) can cause issues with printing.  Therefore, outputting the Word or PowerPoint file as a PDF reduces the embedded content to actual document size, then the second PDF generation (using a web browser) has the effect of ""flattening"" the file, reducing the file's internal complexity and making it more 'print friendly' without losing the quality of print.    More Complex PDF Files    A Tip for more successful printing of 'more complex' PDF files:      Many PDF files (especially forms like tax forms, documents with a lot of legalese, or multiple embedded images) will have a fair amount of embedded content in the document that has not been suitably prepared for printing, resulting in files that either take a very long time to print each page or may not print at all.  By using a web browser to 'print' as a new PDF, the output is more ""flattened"" and the internal content is no longer as complex as only the content that is viewable remains, thus making a file that is more 'print friendly' without losing the quality of print."

Check out the article Detecting Phishing.         Preferred Method    Using the ""Report"" Function in Outlook    If you suspected that you have received a phishing email or other scam emails, keep all interactions with the email to a minimum. The best way to report these emails is to use the built-in ""Report"" Function of Microsoft Outlook.     When you preview an email you can select the ""Report"" drop-down menu. Select the ""Report phishing"" option.        After you have reported the email, and if you are worried about your information's security, you should change or reset your password. You can do this process yourself or you can call or chat with the IT Service Desk and they can help you with your password reset.         Alternative Methods    If for whatever reason this process does not work for you you can follow the following instructions based on your way of accessing your school email. You can send the phishing email, as an attachment, to phishing@byui.edu to report the phishing or scam email.         From the Outlook Webapp (accessed through your BYU-Idaho account)    1. Sign into your BYUI account and open the Outlook webapp.        2. In your Outlook inbox, select New Message.        3. After the new message opens, select the Open in a new window button in the top right-hand corner of your new message.        4. After the new window opens, create a split screen between your email inbox and the new window so that both are visible. Address the new email to phishing@byui.edu        5. In your inbox, click and drag the suspect phishing email over to the body text field of your new message draft.         6. You will see the phishing email appear as an attachment in the body of your new message draft.        7. Click Send. There is a Send button at the top and the bottom of the email draft, either one will work.             From the Outlook Desktop App app on PC (installed and accessed on your desktop computer)    1. Open the Outlook Desktop App.    2. Select the suspect phishing email in your inbox.        3. Select More from the Respond section of the Home tab. This will open a drop-down menu with the option Forward as Attachment.        4. Select Forward as Attachment. This will open a new message draft in a new window with the suspicious email as an attachment.        5. Address the new message draft to phishing@byui.edu.        6. Click Send.             From the Outlook Desktop App on Mac (installed and accessed on your desktop computer)    1. Open the Outlook Desktop App        2. Find the suspect phishing email and right click the email.        3. Select Forward As Attachment from the drop-down menu.        3.

You can easily fix this by updating your password in your device settings.      Difference between the BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi and the BYU-Idaho Wi-Fi    The BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi is intended primarily for ecclesiastical leaders serving on campus. This network allows bishops and stake presidents to process missionary applications and endorsements without the need to log into the campus network. In addition, this network may benefit other campus visitors like non-student dependents, parents of students, and various conference attendees.      The BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi network is filtered like other campus networks, and the types of websites accessible from this network are more limited than the current BYU-Idaho Wi-Fi. For example, popular streaming sites such as Netflix and Hulu are blocked. More importantly, Canvas cannot be accessed on BYUI_Visitor Wi-Fi. Users attempting to access a blocked site may see either an “Application Blocked” page or the page simply will not load. Because of the restrictions that have been imposed on the BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi, students and employees will find the current BYU-Idaho Wi-Fi to be better suited to their needs. They should not view the Visitor Wi-Fi as a non-authenticated replacement or an alternative.         Updating Wi-Fi password on an iPhone    1. Open Settings and tap Wi-Fi.        2.
