Internally, we call it Pathify since that's the name of our vendor, but externally it maintains the myBYUI branding and name. The same web URL (mybyui.edu) is used and any saved bookmarks should continue to work for the next 12 months, as we've set up URL redirects. The site is a web tool developed by a third-party company (Pathify). The branding, content, settings, etc., are still maintained by the University. University Relations are the primary content managers of the tool. However, our IT engineer, John Martinez, is the assigned ASE, and is our primary contact for issues requiring escalation.     For more information about the tool, please visit the Pathify documentation in the system catalog.     Issues    Environment    Resolution for TIER    Standard Web Issues    Since Pathify is web-based, we'll need to perform routine web troubleshooting (clear cache, cookies, Incognito, etc.) for basic issues. For any web-based technical issues that cannot be solved by our basic web troubleshooting techniques, please recommend the user contact Pathify's Support using the information below:         Advisor, Employee & SRR tabs    The advisor, employee, and SRR tabs will be moved to the student.byui.edu web domain. Along with other sites will redirect to the Old my.byui.edu    Note: The edit button will redirect to the old my.BYUI.edu          Slow Widget Load Times    Why is the widget taking too much time to load?     Currently, there is a known issue of the widgets being slow.          Submitting Feedback    How do I submit feedback?

Also ensure the requestor has DUO Mobile installed to their device. DUO pushes are our preferred method for 2FA.     1. The requestor will first need to log into their BYUI account through their phone. Below is a picture of what it will look like. Click ""Need Help?""        2. After they have clicked ""Need help?"",  they will be brought this screen:         3. Depending on the requestor's issue, choose ""I got a new phone"" or ""I need to manage devices.""    4. This will take them to a screen where they need to authenticate. If they can do so with their old phone, have them verify that way. If they can't, have them click the Bypass Code option and create one for them on duo admin. (Refer to Creating a Bypass for Duo)        5. After authenticating, the requestor will be brought to their devices page and it will look similar to this:        6. From here, refer to either the Same Phone Number section or New Phone Number depending on the requestor's issue.         Same Phone Number    If the requestor is adding a new device but has the same phone number do the following:    7. Click ""I have a new phone"" under the phone number that they are still using.    8. They will be taken to the page below. Click ""Get started.""        9. They will be asked to download Duo Mobile. If they do not yet have it, they can install at this point and then click ""Next.""        10. To link the app to their account, they can now click ""Continue"" if they are doing this process on the device they have Duo Mobile installed on. If they are using their computer or another device, they can choose to ""Get an activation link instead."" Once they click ""continute"" or the activation link, they will be taken to Duo Mobile and the requestor will be asked to name the account. ""BYU-Idaho"" is default.        11. From this point they should have access to use DUO Pushes to that device.             New Phone Number    If the requestor has a different phone number do the following:    7. From the manage devices page, click on ""Add a device""        8. Select ""Duo Mobile"" if they are able to get the app on their phone. If they are unable to, select ""Phone number.""        9. Have them add the new phone number. If they are on a Tablet they will skip the phone number portion.        10. They will be asked to download Duo Mobile. If they do not yet have it, they can install at this point and then click ""Next.""        11. If they are doing this process on their phone, they will get the following screen. Click ""Continue."" They will be taken to Duo Mobile and the requestor will be asked to name the account. ""BYU-Idaho"" is default. (If they are using their computer or another device, go to the next step)        12. If they are using a computer, they will get the following screen. They can open the duo app, click ""Add,"" and scan the QR code on their computer screen to log in. Or, they can choose to ""Get an activation link instead."" If they do, they will be asked to put in their email, and the activation link will be sent there. They will be taken to Duo Mobile and the requestor will be asked to name the account. ""BYU-Idaho"" is default.        13. From this point they should have access to use DUO Pushes to that device.             Escalation     If the issue continues you can go into your DUO Admin Portal and add the new device and number for them."

To prevent the student from getting locked out of their account again, check the specifics of the lock out on lockoutstatus.exe and, if needed, do a password reset with them so they will remember their password.     Remember when doing a password reset you MUST either verify their identity through a duo push or see a valid government issued ID (or I-card) by having a zoom call with the requestor.              Using Admin Password Reset to Unlock    We do have the ability to unlock a requestor's account after too many failed attempts. The way to do this is to use the Admin Password Reset tool to verify their identity and then when you hit 'search' instead of seeing the regular screen for forgotten passwords, there is a red banner message that states the account is locked and an option to unlock the account below.        When the account has been successfully unlocked, you may instruct the requestor to attempt to log in again. If they have another failed attempt, invite the requestor to reset their password and continue with an admin password reset (an option shown below).              Escalation    Note: escalation for this issue should only be done after trying to do an admin password reset and contacting Student Records and Registration to see if there are underlying reasons why the account is locked.     If none of those steps work, send the ticket to Identity Management (Tier 3) and explain all that you have tried so far."

They need to resolve these holds before they can see the check box next to the desired courses and register for them.     Registering Too Early or Too Late    Each semester, registration starts at different dates depending on how many credits a student has. If a student tries to register before it is open for them, or after the first week of classes, they will not be able to see the check box next to the course name.     Off-track Students    Students that are trying to register sometimes forget their track assignment and attempt to sign up for classes for their off track. This will also cause the checkbox to disappear until they request to override their off track and permission is given.     International Students    Sometimes, the box shows only for one of the courses or not at all when it comes to international students. This is because they are only allowed to have 3 credits or one online class out of the 12 credits to be considered a full-time student.

Once in role manager, click on users in the left-hand column and type in the requestor's first and last name. Confirm their account by hovering your mouse over their name and make sure the email they give you and the one that pops up are the same.     If you are able to find them on role manager, check active holds.    To check holds go to the quick link on the TD dashboard and type in their I-Number.     If they do have an active hold, let them know they have a hold *but DO NOT let them know what the hold is.* Let them know what department the hold is under and offer to transfer them to that department.     Explain that the hold will have information to where to call, and what to do to resolve it. (According to https://www.byui.edu/registration/resolve-holds)    If they have an active hold from the Health Center, they won't be able to access their account until they take care of the hold. If they have a hold from any other place, they will have access to their account.

Refer to the KB article on Password Resets for more information on how to do this.     Escalation    If you or the requestor are not able to create a new password, contact Student Records and Registration (ext 1021) and ask them to double-check the information they have against what you have to see if they have any additional information.    If the requestor still cannot access their account and you have tried all the options above, send the ticket to “Identity Management (Tier 3)”. Get the requestor's personal email (they will not be able to access their school one) as well as a good phone number to contact them.

These softwares can include (but are not limited to):     Try to ""allow"" or ""make an exception"" for byui.edu in the anti-virus software's settings. In most cases, disabling a ""web shield"", ""firewall"" or ""web content filtering"" should do the trick. The example below is from ""Avast""        End Specific or Suspicious Background Tasks in Task Manager    Some application or ""Tasks"" interfere with peoples' web browsing. To see this, open Task Manager (Ctrl + Alt + Delete) and look for process running that seem ""out-of-the-ordinary"".

SJ Pulse is a service that records users' web browsing activities in exchange for points, that can later be redeemed for rewards like real money. (gift cards, PayPal, etc.) Due to privacy laws, users must opt-in to SJ Pulse and install a browser extension to earn those rewards. The extension actually comes in the form of a desktop application that will run in the background.        While looking at Task Manager, search for SJ Pulse, ""End"" that task, and try accessing the blocked website again. This should solve the requestor's issue.    Note: SJ Pulse is marked by BYU-Idaho's firewall as a potentially dangerous virus or software that will steal their information. Advise the requestor not to have SJ Pulse.     Escalation    If the student is on campus, you can recommend them to go to the MC Help Desk if their problem is still not solved after remote help."

If you've requested it before, then you probably just need to login and download the Adobe Creative Cloud application which will allow you to update/download the most recent updated applications. The enterprise license you've received will allow you to download nearly all Adobe applications. Here are those steps:    Log-in Steps    1. Go to https://creativecloud.adobe.com/.    2. In the email address field, enter your BYU-I email address.        3. After clicking continue, you will be redirected to the BYU-Idaho single-sign-on page (SSO). If a BYU-I student, have them sign in as normal using their username and password. If they are a Pathway Worldwide (PWOL) student, have them sign in sign the Pathway Worldwide Login.    4. On the middle-right side of the screen, under your profile name, click the ""Install Creative Cloud App"".        5. After that, click ""Save"" and download the provided installer file and go through the process of installing the Creative Cloud Application onto your device.    6. After the download is complete, launch the application. It will then prompt you to sign-in again to the application. Remember to sign in the way described above, first with your email.     From there, you should be able to download any Adobe product that you require.          Escalation    If a student is in one of the courses that should have access and does not have access, create a Service Request and assign it to Application Support (Tier 3)."

Click the link that says ""Request Incomplete Contract""    4. Follow instructions as directed. The student must meet the requirements for the Incomplete Contract. The following is the list of the requirements. you can find the requirements in the link provided above.    Extenuating circumstances occurred (serious illness, pregnancy, personal injury, death in the immediate family, etc.) that hindered class work and occurred after the 10th week of a semester (4th week of a block).     **Note: Students whose extenuating circumstances arise after the drop deadlines but before the 10th week of the semester or 4th week of a block should petition for an official withdrawal with the Student Records and Registration Office and should not be allowed to enter into an Incomplete Contract.    The student must have a passing grade at the time of petitioning for the incomplete grade. It is not a substitute for a failing grade. Therefore, an incomplete grade cannot be granted if the student is failing a class and wants additional time to submit makeup work in order to improve a grade.    The student must be able to complete the remaining work on an individual basis with the instructor. Re-enrollment in all or part of the same course during a subsequent semester may not be required as part of the contract.    Instructor approval is mandatory; incomplete contracts are granted at the instructor’s discretion.    After Sending the Request    The SRR (Student Records and Registration) will be the ones processing this ""Request"".     Records and Registration updates the student's ""enrollment"" in the system, but the team that changes the student's enrollment in the class is I-Learn Admin.    If there is any assignment, quiz or content that was locked behind an end date, the instructor will have to go in and change the end dates or grant special access to the student manually.

This can make things extra difficult and confusing for us when we are trying to help them or figure out if they should turn to pathway support instead. Here is how we can tell the difference.     Pathway Connect:    For these students when you try to look them up in Roles or in TD you will not be able to find them. These students will need to go to Pathway Support for assistance, although there are rare occasions where clearing cache and cookies may resolve their problems.     Pathway Worldwide:    These student accounts are a bit more tricky. You will be able to see them in Role Manager but if you look at their usernames they all start with the letter U followed by some numbers. In TD they have a BYUI email address but it says under their name that they are Pathway Worldwide. In most cases these students will also need to reach out to Pathway Support to receive assistance. However, we can assist these students with any DUO issues they might have and try basic troubleshooting with them. Sometimes Pathway Worldwide Students need assistance as simple as knowing where to sign in, we can assist them by doing a screen share. We should try to assist them as much as possible before sending them back to Pathway Support.            BYU-I:    When you look up these students they will show as an on track, off track, or online student in TD with a BYUI email address and I-Number.

You can obtain all of this information using the 999 report, but you will need their I-number so make sure you have the correct TD profile pulled up with the correct I-number. If you cannot find their I-number please talk to your shift lead, IT Operations Supervisors, or Mary Jo.     d. You will then be given a message saying, ""A username has already been created for this user"" along with fields for a New Password, Confirm Password, Security Question, and Control Email.

Employees are encouraged to review this document often for any changes to it.    Time Commitment      Shifts: Employees are expected to work the same daily shift for the duration of each semester. Depending on availability and at the discretion of your designated coordinator, part-time employees may work more than the allotted 15 hours per week during Saturday shifts designated for this purpose. In addition to the regular shift, all employees are expected to work a minimum of two Saturday shifts throughout the semester and if an employee is unable to work on a Saturday, they will need to have it approved by the IT Operations Coordinator or IT Operations Manager.     Meetings: Employees are expected to attend the biweekly roundtable discussion (held on Thursdays during forum hour). Employees are also expected to attend other department meetings and one-on-one meetings with their supervisors. Any absence from these meetings will need to be approved by their supervisor.     Devotional:  The following is an email from Human Resources regarding Devotional Attendance:  ""BYU-Idaho faculty and student managers are asked to encourage all BYU-Idaho students to attend the university devotional every Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. in the BYU-Idaho Center. While there are many ways to receive spiritual nourishment, weekly devotionals are part of the unique BYU-Idaho experience. Participating in these inspirational gatherings strengthens both individuals and the university as a whole. Student employees may receive approval from their supervisor to record devotional attendance as work time if they are scheduled to work directly before or after devotional. Supervisors can make appropriate decisions based on unique needs and schedules in order to provide this approval. However, if student employees are assigned or required to attend as part of their work, they must be compensated for their time. Students, faculty, and staff are invited to set aside work and assignments for the scheduled 45 minutes each week. Please gather with the campus community and be uplifted by the weekly messages.""     Attendance: Employees are expected to arrive 5 minutes early and work their entire scheduled shift. Full-time and part-time workers may not clock in more than 5 minutes before their shift starts without approval from their shift lead. Employees who will be late must contact their team lead in advance of tardiness.     In the event of an emergency or illness, employees must notify their assigned shift lead at least 15 minutes prior to the start of their shift. (Shift lead contact information is made available to all employees on the Shift Schedule contact list.) If this is not possible for any given reason, they will be required to email the IT Service Desk Manager at vallejor@byui.edu. Important: the employee must be the one to communicate (spouses, roommates, friends, or even co-workers are not acceptable).     Employees are expected to use the ""Check-in/Check-Out"" feature in Workday. In case of forgetting to do so, or not being able to, the employees must notify their Shift Lead as soon as possible and before making any changes. It is strictly prohibited to manually change or enter time without letting the Shift Lead know. If the change needs to happen for several days of the week, the Shift Lead must be the one doing the time update, not the employee.     Employees must only clock in as soon as they are marked ready in the phone system or chat queue and are ready to accept phone calls or chats (do not clock in for travel time or for socializing time before the shift begins). Employees must be in their seats actively ready to work.     Employees who work a shift more than 4 hours consecutively in duration are entitled to a 15-minute break. You must arrange your 15-minute break with your Supervisor. 15-minute breaks cannot be taken at the beginning or end of a shift or lunch. If extenuating circumstances arise, the 15-minute break can be taken at those times if approved by a supervisor.       The IT Service Desk reserves the right to call students in due to a high demand of phone calls on optional days including Saturdays.      Time Off: Time off requests are submitted on Workday and must be submitted at least 72 hours prior to the day(s) in question. These requests must be approved by a supervisor. Employees are allowed, but not guaranteed, up to two days a month in which they can miss work, a total of 6 days each semester. Requests in excess of this must be discussed directly with the Operations Supervisor.      No time off will be permitted in the first 2 weeks of the semester unless it is for illness. Any time off requests within the first 2 weeks need to be approved by your team lead and the Operations Supervisor or QA Supervisor when applicable.     All time off requests, regardless of length, are dependent upon individual work performance and the workload of the team, as a whole.     Full-time: A limited number of full-time, student-employee positions are available each semester. Full-time slots may be requested but are granted at the discretion of the Service Desk Manager and are not guaranteed. It is recommended, but not required, that you request Full-Time well in advance of the semester you would like to work full-time.     Call and Chat Avoidance      All employees assigned to the phones or chats are expected to take all incoming assigned interactions delivered from our queues. If an employee is caught either negligently or intentionally avoiding phone calls/chats, he/she will be subject to coaching and discipline, up to and including termination. If an employee needs to take either a bathroom or work break, it is their responsibility to arrange this with their shift lead. As soon as an employee returns from said break, they are expected to immediately change their agent status to “Ready.”     Non-work-related activities      Schoolwork, personal projects, web browsing, social media, instant messaging, videos (i.e.: YouTube), and any other non-work-related activities are strictly prohibited.     Keep phone usage to a minimum. If phone usage becomes abused, management reserves the right to prohibit all phone usage. This could indicate for individual, team, or office.      You are not allowed to be on your cell phone when you are in the middle of contact, even if you are on hold.       For privacy and security reasons, personal laptops/tablets should remain with the remainder of your personal belongings and should not be used while at your workstation.     Prolonged visitation (including phone calls and texting) of friends/family/others who are not associated with Information Technology projects is not appropriate. If someone does visit, take your conversation outside of the workroom.     Conversations should be work-related, please keep other discussions to a minimum.     Employees who are not on their shift will not be permitted to linger in the office, as it will cause distractions for those who are working during their assigned shift.      Use of Equipment and Space      Downloading music, videos, or any other non-work related, external files is prohibited. Software updates or any other file downloads require supervisor approval.     Computer crime is a criminal offense and is also against the BYU–Idaho Honor Code. Employees who knowingly access any campus-owned computer, system, or program without prior authorization are committing a crime. Individuals caught doing so may be subject to criminal and/or civil law as well as dismissal from BYU–Idaho.     Printing or copying for personal use is prohibited.     FERPA policies are strictly enforced. All employees are required to successfully complete FERPA training upon hire.     Manipulating, adjusting, or editing student grades in any way is strictly prohibited.     IT requires access to sensitive data. Do not abuse those permissions.     Employees should be responsible with computers, workspaces, and hardware; this includes keeping workspaces clean and professional in appearance.     Dress and Grooming Standards      All student employees are to abide by the BYU-Idaho-approved dress code for student employees. This dress code requires student employees to wear business casual attire every day.      Men are expected to wear khakis or dress pants, a button-down shirt, and a tie.     Shaving exceptions (“Beard Cards”) are not accepted and all men are required to be cleanly shaven.     Women are expected to wear khakis or dress pants and a blouse, a knee-length (or longer) skirt, and a blouse, or a knee-length (or longer) dress.     Jeans (of any color) are not appropriate work attire.     In all aspects, employees should follow the BYU-Idaho honor code. All attire should be clean and professional. This includes shoe choice, hairstyles, personal grooming, etc.     Phone Call/Chat/Ticket Expectations      Analysts will be audited on phone calls, chats, and tickets. The interactions will be graded on a scale of 1-100. If an analyst scores below 85 percent, a meeting with the lead will be scheduled to help, train, and make goals with the analyst on the specific part of the process that was below expectations. If no improvement is noticed after the training is given, the warning process may take place. The warning process consists of a verbal warning, and then a written warning. After the written warning is given and no improvement is made, the employee will be terminated.     Disclaimers      Employee expectations are subject to change at any time. Employees will be notified of changes to this document.     Continued employment is based on employee performance and department needs.     Shift Leads are official Service Desk supervisors and have the jurisdiction to handle disciplinary actions for their team.     Failure to meet the expectations outlined above will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination."

https://td.byui.edu/SBTDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=13565,Assets/CI,Technology how-to ticket equipment assets associate asset-management Asset CI,"Summary    This article provides a simplified overview of Assets/CI specifically for analysts and technicians. We will cover the ""why"", ""what"", ""how"" Assets are used, and it's application to daily operations, like on incident and service request tickets. Benefits and features of using this tool will briefly be covered, as well as general practices of asset management.     What is Assets/CI?    Simply stated, Assets/CI is an asset management system that's built right into our ticketing system (TeamDynamix) and is available throughout the entire TDX ecosystem. Assets and CIs can be directly associated with an incident or service request. Once associated, technicians and analysts can click on the asset/CI details with all related assets/CIs in a list and a visual relationship map (coming soon) and view any past tickets related to that Asset.     Using this tool allows us to add, edit, track, and update information for IT assets such as hardware, software, systems, etc; the most applicable to the IT Service Desk and Tier 2 Support being hardware (desktop computers, laptops, tablets, etc.). Doing so allows us to leverage asset information on our tickets and displaying pertinent device information for technicians. Another benefit of using the Assets/CI functionality is that it allows us to keep a ticket history on the device (I.e., when did the device begin having problems, what was the nature of the issue, who worked on it, what was done, etc.).    To learn more about this Assets & CI's from TeamDynamix, visit teamdynamix.com/it-service-management-itsm/it-asset-management    *examples include: a computer that won't connect to campus printers    Why use Assets/CI    In general, technology, in terms of both hardware and software, represent a significant financial investment from both tuition and tithing funds. Managing IT assets is one of our department's primary responsibilities; it's a part of being a responsible steward over the investments the Church and the University have provided for employees and students at BYU-Idaho. In an effort to be better stewards, improve processes, effectively organize data, and improve access to pertinent information for IT technicians, analysts, etc., we've implemented a tool within TeamDynamix called Assets/CI.    As of August 22nd, 2023, all tickets, including both Incidents and Service Requests, that pertain to an asset*, such as a University-owned desktop computer or laptop, must accurately specify the corresponding Asset in the designated Asset/CI field. This responsibility lies the analyst or technician creating the ticket (also known as the ""ticket creator"").    How to use Assets/CI    For normal day-to-day operations, analysts and technicians will use the Assets/CI field on incident and service requests forms for any/all tickets that pertain to a University owned, campus-issued device (at the moment, this only includes desktop computers, laptops, tablets). In another words, if a ticket pertains to a device that the IT department services, it needs to be indicated on the Assets/CI field on the ticket, regardless of ticket classification (incident or service request). Configuration Items (CI's) are also included in our database and are only used by product managers, software engineers, and select IT management for the purpose of tracking software and system issues, similar to how assets are tracked in TDX.     Each asset in TeamDynamix is documented and tagged on its own Asset form, which includes some of the following information: serial number, asset tag (labeled as ""service tag""), location, MAC address, type of equipment, assigned user, and asset description. Some of the key fields our support teams will use most are asset tag and location (I.e., building and room number of where the device is located and assigned).     Assets/CI Field    The Assets/CI field on ticket forms is found on both incident and service requests and is typically located near the top of the form. In the field, an analyst or technician may enter, search, or look-up the asset. In the search field you can use the following:    Name (or name of device which is also found on the title of the asset form)    Serial Number    ID (specific to TDX and is not the asset tag number)    Service Tag (the asset tag number)    If none of those options work, the magnifying glass button can be used for more search options. Since assets are assigned to ""owners"" the employee will also have their assigned device associated in their TDX account. This information is found by simply clicking on the requestor's name, which will provide a list of assigned assets under the ""Assets"" tab on their profile.     Once the asset is associated with the ticket, any subsequent analyst or technician can follow the data regarding that asset. This is done by simply clicking the Assets/CI tab on the top of the ticket form. Clicking the on the Asset ID field, will then open up a new window revealing the associated asset form and all its details and information. There will be important, yet highly confidential information* contained, which should not be shared or used without appropriate business cause; caution should thus be exercised.     *information provided in our systems is protected and governed by University policies and requires professional judgement and use by IT employees. For more information, please refer to the employee expectations (applies to IT Service Desk employees)    Questions and/or Feedback    Got questions?

Create a title for the ticket, and a brief description of the issue (5 or fewer words).    6. Make sure the form is correct (Incident or Service Request). In this case, it would be a Service Request.    7. Fill in the type.    8. Fill in the description section, putting in as much information as you can. The description needs to be 3-4 sentences. Remember to ask probing questions.          The following should be included in EVERY ticket you create:         Note: If the issue is an error they are receiving you MUST include a screenshot of the error.    9.

A good example of a service request is a user request for a password reset. Other examples might include a request for an answer to a common question or for a standard pre-approved update to a workstation configuration.    General Incident    An incident is an unplanned interruption to an IT service or a reduction in the quality of an IT service. For example, a user cannot connect to the wireless network (also known as WiFi). The ITIL incident management process ensures that normal service operation is restored as quickly as possible so that business impact is minimized. These incidents normally only impact one or a few individuals. View this article on General Incidents.    Major Incident    A major incident is an event that has a significant impact or urgency for the business/organization and which demands a response beyond the routine incident management process. A major incident will be an incident that is either defined in the major incident procedure or which: may either cause, or have the potential to cause, impact on business-critical services or systems (which can be named in the major incident procedure); or be an incident that has significant impact on reputation, legal compliance, regulation or security of the business/organization. For example: complete network/internet outage for all users on campus. Major incidents are managed by the Major Incident Manager (MIM). View this KB on Major Incidents.

Urgency    Prompt a conversation to figure out how they can still do what they need to do. Ask questions to figure out what options they have.

To connect to their computer after successfully connecting to the VPN and launching Remote Desktop Connection, they will need their computer IP address or computer name (such as 19MCK322-177309).

An employee's computer's name will contain that employee's name in the computer's name. If the computer's name is not the employee's name, then a new IP address has been assigned to the computer.

To do that, open command prompt and type the prompt below, filling in their ip address or computer name. If no reply is received after pinging the computer, proceed to esclation.

Tier 2 will then send the IP address and name of the computer to the user and the user should be able to connect.

It is through this understanding that we can ensure that our content is relevant, accessible, and valuable to those who rely on it.     Defining the Target Audience    Our university caters to a wide and diverse range of individuals, each with unique needs and expectations. Here's how we define our audience for public tech guides and knowledge-base articles:    1. On-Campus Students    Demographics: Diverse student population attending classes in person    Interests and Knowledge Level: Varies based on academic majors and experience    Goals and Objectives: Seek IT Support for campus resources, classroom technology, and academic tools    Pain Points and Challenges: May require assistance with campus network access, software installations, Learning Management tools, and device troubleshooting         2. Online Students    Demographics: Diverse online student population studying remotely    Interests and Knowledge Level: Varies based on online program specifics and experience    Goals and Objectives: Access online learning platforms, e-library resources, textbooks, and technical assistance    Pain Points and Challenges: Inability to access Pathway’s website for IT personnel, Learning Management System, and online resource navigation         2. Faculty and Staff    Demographics: varied staff roles within the university    Interests and Knowledge Level: Varied, ranging from academic to administrative topics.    Goals and Objectives: Access resources for teaching, research, and university administration.    Pain Points and Challenges: May seek assistance with technology tools, software, and technical issues         3. Potential Students (Prospective and Applicants)    Demographics: Prospective students are often younger, while applicants come from various backgrounds.    Interests and Knowledge Level: Varies based on the stage of the application process.    Goals and Objectives: Seek information on logging in to BYUI and other technical issues    Pain Points and Challenges: May need guidance on application processes and how to access BYUI services         Why Audience Matters    Understanding our diverse audience is essential for several reasons:    1. Relevance    By tailoring our content to the specific needs and interests of each audience segment, we can ensure that our tech guides and knowledge base articles remain relevant and helpful.    2. Clarity    Recognizing the varying levels of expertise and knowledge allows us to choose the right language and tone to communicate effectively.    3.

https://td.byui.edu/SBTDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=13960,Article Status Definitions,KCS-Article-Status,"Not Submitted    In the KCS Knowledge Management process, knowledge starts in the ""Not Submitted"" stage. At this initial phase, knowledge items do not exist within the organization's knowledge base. Analysts may encounter new issues, questions, or solutions that have not yet been documented. These new knowledge items are identified but are awaiting formalization and inclusion in the knowledge base.    Submitted    When an analyst identifies a new knowledge item or solution, they ""Submit"" it for consideration and formalization. This is the point at which knowledge is introduced to the knowledge management process. Submitters provide details and context surrounding the knowledge item, ensuring that it aligns with organizational objectives and is suitable for inclusion in the knowledge base.    Approved    For knowledge to be effective and reliable, it must undergo a review and approval process. In the ""Approved"" stage, the submitted knowledge item is thoroughly evaluated by designated experts (Knowledge Management Team). If it meets the organization's quality and relevance criteria, it is granted the status of ""Approved"" and is ready for integration into the knowledge base.    Rejected    Not all knowledge submissions will meet the criteria for approval. Some knowledge items may be ""Rejected"" due to inaccuracies, incompleteness, or a lack of alignment with organizational goals. The rejection stage is crucial for maintaining the quality and reliability of the knowledge base.    Archived    Knowledge management is an ongoing process, and as the organization evolves, so does the knowledge base. Over time, older knowledge items may become less relevant or out-of-date. These knowledge items are ""Archived"" for reference, but are no longer actively promoted. Archiving ensures that the knowledge base remains up-to-date and continues to provide relevant information to support staff and customers."
