When employees leave BYUI, their devices need to be returned to IT or wiped for their replacements. If it is a windows device, the employee just need to leave the computer, power supply, and docking station with their department secretary who will take care of the device from there. If it is an apple device however, the device needs to be removed from the employee's apple account before it is left with their secretary. Below are the steps on how to remove the device. This applies for all Apple devices (Mac computers, tablets etc).
1. Go to System Settings on the device you want to remove from your Apple account.
2. Click ""Apple ID"" (name at the top).
3. Scroll to the bottom and click ""Sign Out.""

4. If you would like to keep a copy of your data, click ""Keep a Copy"" in the window that pops up. If you don't want to keep a copy, uncheck all the boxes and click ""Continue.""

5. Once you are signed out of the device, simply leave it with your department secretary. They will take care of the process of returning the device to IT (or getting it wiped for the next employee) from there.
 
If for any reason the above process doesn't work, there is another way to remove the device, as outlined below. If this is being done from a phone/tablet instead of a computer, open the Find My app and skip to step 5.
1. Go to iCloud.com and click Sign In

2. Sign in using your personal Apple ID

3. You will be taken to your account page. In the section of apps, click and open ""Find My""

4. It will ask you for your Apple ID password again

5. At the top, click ""All Devices"" then find the BYUI device that you are returning

6. Click ""Remove from Account""

7. Once the device is removed, simply leave it with your department secretary. They will take care of the process of returning the device to IT (or getting it wiped for the next employee) from there.

Students and staff will still have access to their university email (@byui.edu) even after graduating or retiring. Most people will be able to access their email on their campus alumni portal. Any alumni since 2009 have automatically been granted continued access to email. Any alumni prior to 2009 can have their account re-created (fresh and new, with no prior messages) upon request to the Email team through a ticket assigned to them.
Questions that the email team will need to ask before resurrecting their account:"

This form is intended for family members that are requesting access to their missionary's student account while they are away on a two-year mission.
Once these steps are completed, the family member(s) listed on the MPR may request additional support in the future, if they somehow get locked out of the account. The MPR will remain on the student's record, so we can assist the family in the future at any time an issue arises.

Here is a list of the most common questions on what you can and cannot do/get as an alumni or retiree from BYU-Idaho.
Retirees will have access to their email forever.  However, retirees will only have access to other Office 365, G-Suite, and Zoom products until midnight of the last payroll after they retire. After that point, they will be only be able to use Office if they've downloaded Microsoft Office (not 365) off the Hub.
Alumni are the same but the date is tied to their last grade posting.
If you are an employee that will retire and your BYUI-Provided computer is set to be replaced that year, you can buy out the computer. If it is not set to be replaced that year, you must return it to the university.
Duo authentication will stop being required as soon as your employee/student's status changes into retiree/alumni.
After you are set to retirees and alumni, respectively, by HR, you will:
As a retiree or alumni, you also do not have access to myBYUI. However, there are other direct links you can access directly.
Here are helpful links to access information outside of myBYUI:
Retirees can still access BYUI Wi-Fi. They can use the main Wi-Fi and authenticate, however they only get the same accesses as the visitor network.

https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=12448,Logging Out of BYUI Webpages,log out logout where button the,"
BYU-Idaho has spent a lot of time and energy removing technological barriers for our students and employees. The IT department is committed to: ""Simplification"" and putting  ""People-First."" Having said that, we spend time simplifying your experience by looking at your experience with our tools, systems, and software. You are important to us. So every decision we make is grounded on the premise of how it impacts our customers. In the process, we have strategically designed your logging experience at BYU-Idaho to be quick, simple, and convenient. The following FAQs will help answer common questions customers have about their experience ""logging out"" of their BYUI accounts. 
NOTE: BYUI will be switching to this new page on February 16, 2024
To log out of byui.pathify.com (or the ""new my.byui page""), follow the steps below
1. Click your profile picture in the top right
2. In the dropdown menu, click ""lougout""
You will then be taken to a page that says ""Logout Successful""

You've probably been wondering this for a while. And the simple answer is: there is no logout button. We've purposely designed our websites to exclude this option. Therefore, in most cases, you just won't see one. 
Another common, but great question! The reason there is no ""logout"" button is strategically explained by the customer experience we've architected. We put your ease, simplicity, and efficiency in using all BYUI tools and software at the top of our priorities. In order to accomplish this principle, IT engineers have designed what's commonly called a ""Single Sign On"" (aka, SSO), authentication service. In other words, if you login once on a webpage, any other browser tab or window which requires a BYUI username and password won't require our customer to sign-in again; hence ""single sign-on."" Sign in once, and you're done—at least until you quit and close your browser. Closing your browser automatically logs you out of all BYUI websites. 
IT engineers have again taken your experience into consideration. Therefore, yes, there is a way you can still log out of your account. It's just not as readily available or commonly known. Having said that here is how you log out:"

The Help Desk provides in person, walk-up tech support to students and employees. It is staffed by technicians that are trained in basic hardware and software troubleshooting. It is a place students can go if they need assistance with their personal devices and employees can go if they need assistance with their BYU-Idaho owned devices. (NOTE: Preferred location to assist employees is in their office.) An appointment is not needed for the Help Desk and assistance is available on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Zoom is the official BYU-Idaho tool for video conferencing and screen sharing. BYU-Idaho is licensed for an unlimited number of Zoom meetings with up to 100 participants. Zoom is hosted via the internet. It should work well even when many people are using it. However, video chat can consume a high amount of bandwidth. We will be working with the vendor to monitor its load and capacity.
 
 
 
The following questions should help you determine the right path forward:
 
As an employee at BYU-Idaho, you can save files to Microsoft OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams. It is recommended you save all your work to one of these products. However, saving personal files to these platforms is not supported by the I.T. department.
Saving files to Microsoft OneDrive, SharePoint, and/or Teams will automatically back up your files and allow you to share them with others. You should never store any sensitive BYU-Idaho data or files on your personal device.
See the following links for additional resources on how to use these products:
 
With your direct supervisor’s approval, you can take your monitor, keyboard, mouse, and/or docking station home with your campus-issued laptop.
 
If you require a web camera for working from home, you should work with your department to acquire one through approved purchasing methods (i.e. Amazon).
 
The BYU-Idaho VPN is provided by redundant appliances with a theoretical capacity of 5000 users. Cisco has indicated they will temporarily provide additional free licenses as needed. While the system should scale to many more users, only those who need access to on-campus systems should request VPN access.
 
You may forward your desk phone to a home phone or cell phone by pressing the Forward all button on your desk phone and entering the number you wish to forward calls to.
 
 
 
BYU-Idaho is not equipped to provide internet or network services to students or employees off-campus. Faculty with unreliable connectivity at home may continue to operate from their campus offices as appropriate."

BYU-Idaho provides a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) site that can be accessed via your personal computer. It allows students to access following software:
 
OneDrive is a cloud storage platform where you can save and share documents, presentations, videos, and other files. Each currently enrolled student is given 1 TB of free storage. OneDrive allows you to do the following:
 
Outlook is BYU-Idaho's email provider for communicating with students, faculty, and staff. Email is the official communication channel for BYU-Idaho, and any important updates from the university will be sent through it. You can access Outlook through your Student Home page or through the desktop and mobile Outlook apps. Contact the IT Service Desk at 208-496-1411 for more help. 
 
Proctorio is a remote proctoring system that monitors students while they are taking tests remotely. This allows you to take exams outside of the Testing Center.
 
In a remote course setting, faculty rely more on Canvas for course announcements, class discussions, assignments, quizzes, and posting grades. Access Canvas through I-Learn on your BYU-Idaho Student home page. Help with Canvas can be found on the following articles:

We are adding this security measure to help keep your personal information as safe as possible. Even if someone else knows your username and password, they will not be able to get into your account unless they also have the device that you use to authenticate. 
 
Each authentication lasts for 30 days. That means that unless you’ve recently cleared your history or cache, you’re using a new Internet browser, or you’re using Incognito mode, you will only have to go through the process every 30 days per device.  
EXAMPLE: If you authenticated from your computer in Google Chrome, you would be authenticated for your computer and Google Chrome for 30 days. However, if you tried to access your BYU-Idaho account from the same computer later in the day, but used Safari instead of Google Chrome, you would need to authenticate again. You would then be authenticated for your home computer, for both Google Chrome and Safari, for 30 days. Within those 30 days, you would only need to authenticate again if you used a new device (e.g., a library computer) or another new browser.  
Let’s say that 15 days later, you cleared your cache after I-Learn maintenance. You would then need to authenticate again, and the 30-day period would restart.
 
 
Certain groups of students will receive authorization to begin setting up Duo Mobile accounts starting March 24, 2020. You will receive an email if you are included in one of these groups. A new group of students will be added every Tuesday until all students have been added to Duo Mobile. We hope to reach the completion of the project by June 2020. After that, every new student will join Duo Mobile upon registration at BYU-Idaho.
 
No. We recognize that you will not be able to bring any authentication devices with you into the Testing Center, and so authentication in the Testing Center will not be required.  
 
This means that someone is trying to get into your account. Deny the login request, and immediately change your BYU-Idaho password.
 
Yes. However, you will not need to authenticate when using a work computer that is “wired,” or plugged in, to an Internet connection. For example, if you were using a work computer during your shift you would not need to authenticate. However, when you left work, went to class, and started using your personal computer in class, you would need to authenticate if you had not authenticated for that computer and browser in the last 30 days."

To understand why we need 2-Factor Authentication (2FA), we first need to understand what 2FA is helping to protect. 
If you're worried authenticating is going to be a crazy complicated process, don't be. Simply log in to your BYU-Idaho account and follow the prompts to authenticate into your account. So don't freak out. By using 2FA, you are responsibly safeguarding your account.

Have questions about 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)? Read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) below.
We are adding this security measure to help keep your personal information as safe as possible. Even if someone else knows your username and password, they will not be able to get into your account unless they also have the device that you use to authenticate.  
 
Each authentication lasts for 30 days. That means that unless you’ve recently cleared your history or cache, you’re using a new Internet browser, or you’re using Incognito mode, you will only have to go through the process every 30 days per device.
EXAMPLE: If you authenticated from your home computer in Google Chrome, you would be authenticated for your home computer and Google Chrome for 30 days. However, if you tried to access your BYU-Idaho account from the same computer later in the day, but used Safari instead of Google Chrome, you would need to authenticate again. You would then be authenticated for your home computer, for both Google Chrome and Safari, for 30 days. Within those 30 days, you would only need to authenticate again if you used a new device (e.g., your mobile phone) or another new browser.
Let’s say that 15 days later, you cleared your history. You would then need to authenticate again, and the 30-day period would restart.
 
 
If you don’t have a mobile phone, you can authenticate via a password sent to a token or via a call to a landline phone. If you do have a smartphone, however, we strongly recommend using the push notification option. Not only is this option quicker and easier, it also doesn't cost any money to the school for messaging and data rates. 
 
 
No. You will not need to authenticate as long as the device you’re authenticating from is connected to a BYU-Idaho network.
 
This means that someone is trying to get into your account. Deny the login request, and immediately change your BYU-Idaho password."

Certain groups of students will receive authorization to begin setting up Duo Mobile accounts starting March 24, 2020. You will receive an email if you are included in one of these groups. A new group of students will be added every Tuesday until all students have been added to Duo Mobile. We hope to reach the completion of the project by June 2020. After that, every new student will join Duo Mobile upon registration at BYU-Idaho.
 
No. We recognize that you will not be able to bring any authentication devices with you into the Testing Center, and so authentication in the Testing Center will not be required.  
 
This means that someone is trying to get into your account. Deny the login request, and immediately change your BYU-Idaho password.
 
Yes. However, you will not need to authenticate when using a work computer that is “wired,” or plugged in, to an Internet connection. For example, if you were using a work computer during your shift you would not need to authenticate. However, when you left work, went to class, and started using your personal computer in class, you would need to authenticate if you had not authenticated for that computer and browser in the last 30 days."

To understand why we need 2-Factor Authentication (2FA), we first need to understand what 2FA is helping to protect. 
If you're worried authenticating is going to be a crazy complicated process, don't be. Simply log in to your BYU-Idaho account and follow the prompts to authenticate into your account. So don't freak out. By using 2FA, you are responsibly safeguarding your account.

However, we strongly advise users to be familiar with the setup, configuration, and daily operation of these devices, before making the decision to purchase them. Since there are a wide variety of different brands and models, we cannot make specific device or brand recommendations. Due to the wide variety of brands, models, and specifications BYU-I support personnel cannot troubleshoot or resolve issues arising while using or operating these devices. We highly recommend contacting the manufacturer since they can offer the specific support required for the correct make and model. 
The following criteria must be met to use security keys with a BYU-I DUO account:
DUO makes security keys an option for organizations and BYU-Idaho has elected to allow users to add security keys to their accounts. As with all authentication services, such as usernames and passwords, these security keys should be kept safe, protected, and out of reach of those with unauthorized access. Please keep these devices in a safe location. If you lose your security key, remove it from your DUO account as soon as possible, so the security of your BYUI account remains uncompromised.
Please note: if you are someone easily frustrated by technology, security keys may not be a good option. Security keys are not always a cheap option; prices can range from $19 to $100+. Replacing lost security keys requires purchasing a new key, removing the old device from your DUO account, and adding the replacement. If you DO choose to use a security key, we highly recommend buying at least two (with one as a backup) and having another authentication method enabled on your account (such as DUO Mobile, SMS, etc.). Doing so will prevent you from inadvertently being locked out of your account in the unfortunate situation of a lost key. 
Here are just a few examples of available security keys: 
You must have the device in hand and ready to be plugged into your computer. Adding the security key is quick and easy. Follow these steps:
Important: security keys can only be added by the user. Due to the inherent nature of these devices, namely all security keys are physical hardware devices and must be plugged into the user's device to be configured, the IT Service Desk is limited in how they can help. If you chose to use such a device, please note that you assume all responsibility and the required self-service."

Here is a list of options to try if you do not receive a push notification after enrolling in your phone number.
When you first download the app, a request appears asking you if you would like to allow Duo Mobile to send you notifications. You may have selected ""Don't Allow"" when this notification appeared, but you will have to allow notifications for the Duo Mobile app for it to work properly. 
To allow notifications for Duo Mobile:   
1. Go to Settings.  

2. Scroll down and select Duo Mobile.  

3. Select Notifications.   

4. Allow notifications by tapping on the white toggle button.  

If you are allowing notifications for the Duo Mobile app but are still not receiving notifications, go to the Duo app and pull down the screen. This will refresh your account and load all missing notifications. Approve the authentication request, and you are done.

To use the Duo Mobile app, you will need a strong Internet connection. Try turning the Wi-Fi on and off to reset a wireless network that is having issues connecting to your device. If you have cellular data, turn off your Wi-Fi and use data instead in order to get a better Internet connection.
This article is meant to help you troubleshoot problems with push notifications on an Android device. 
Go to the Duo Mobile app and pull down the screen. This will refresh your account and load all missing notifications. Find the notification you were trying to get and approve the authentication request.
If you are still not getting push notifications, you might need to check that Google Play is updated. If Google Play is out-of-date, update it.
You can also clear the Duo Mobile app cache to try and free up any trapped notifications. To clear the Duo Mobile app cache: 
1. Go to Settings. 
2. Select Apps and scroll down to select Duo Mobile.  

3. Tap Clear Cache.   

If none of the previous steps work, check that you are using a strong Internet connection. Try turning the Wi-Fi on and off to reset the wireless network. If you have cellular data, turn off your Wi-Fi and use data instead in order to get a better Internet connection."

This article provides possible causes and solutions if you do not receive a code when you choose to authenticate via text message.  
Problems receiving text passcodes or authentication verification from Duo could be due to one of the following factors: 
Make sure that your cell phone connection is strong. If your cellular connection is weak, find a place where you have a better connection. If you are using a smart phone, you may be able to improve your cellular data connection by turning Airplane Mode on and off. This will reset the connection and then you will be able to receive the authentication text.   
If you have chosen a mobile phone, then make sure that the phone network connection is strong. You need to have connection in order to receive the call. If you are using a landline, make sure that your phone is connected as well.   
If your phone connection is good, but you still don’t receive a text, there might be a problem with your device.  "

A bypass code is an authentication method reserved for people who cannot used DUO Mobile in other traditional ways. i.e  DUO Push Notification, a text message, phone call, etc.  It is a 9-digit-code that can be used to help be able to change Duo settings or get into your BYU-Idaho account. 
 
In order to get a a bypass code you will need to talk to a member of the IT Service Desk. They will assess your situation and determine if you qualify for a Bypass code.
Depending on you circumstances, the bypass code you receive may have a limited amount of uses or only be used once. The IT Service Desk employee will help inform you about these conditions when you receive a Bypass code. 
You may also be asked to verify you identity before the IT Service Desk employee can give you a bypass code. This is to ensure the safety of you account and stop any identity theft.

If you are locked out of your Duo account due to the error message: ""Your account has been locked out due to excessive authentication failures. Please contact your administrator."" (Shown below)

Please wait 60 minutes before contacting the IT Service Desk. Duo Mobile will put a temporary lock on your account due to what it assumes is suspicious account behavior. But after the 60-minute time period, your account should be unlocked. If your Duo account is locked a second time after the 60 minute timer, you may need to re-add your device, at this point feel free to contact the IT Service Desk.

Please note, this process only applies to plain white paper in Letter, Tabloid, and Legal sizes. Other specialty papers will not be paid by I.T.
The following is the Catalog Item information for each type of plain paper that will now be provided and paid for by I.T. This information can be used to search in Workday for the correct item:
In this new process, Workday will automatically charge I.T. for the order of paper instead of charging the requester's default Cost Center. The Cost Center can be changed in Workday if you prefer. This will not change the cost per page of paper. The paper will be delivered to the location indicated in the purchase order.
If you have previously requested plain paper for a printer using the current online ticket request form, and have not received your order, you will need to request that paper using the new process in Workday instead.

Summary
The IT department is rolling out changes to conference rooms across campus, which includes a new audio/video setup intended to improve simplicity and ease of use for employees. Most conference rooms employ either an AirMedia, Zoom Room, or even a combined setup and has a touch panel for user controls. The new setup no longer requires the touch panel and is a simple plug and play (PnP) setup. With this new setup comes a different ways to connect and allows users to connect both wired and wirelessly. This article covers how to connect to the projector/TV and/or speakers in the newly converted conference rooms using DisplayLink (required for wired connection) and AirMedia (required for wireless connection). Please note: this only applies to newly converted conference rooms and is also available for schedule-able rooms. 
How to Connect

To connect with the provided cable, the user will need to use the DisplayLink application on their device. If the device doesn't already have DisplayLink, the software will need to be installedbefore connecting to the conference room. To install the DisplayLink application, click the download button below for your operating system.
DisplayLink Download
Once downloaded and installed, simply connect the provided USB cable into the user's device. The provided cable connects to both USB-A and USB-C ports (as long as the cable has the included USB adapter connected, if the adapter is missing it will need to be replaced). Once connected, the device should automatically display to the TV/Projector. The provided USB cable also automatically supplies a wired internet connection, which should enable the device to quickly connect to the web. 
To connect wirelessly, the user will need to use the AirMedia application on their device. On the projector or TV screen, in the bottom, left-hand corner, there should be a URL under the ""Present Using Wireless"" screen. In your browser, type the Visit web address in your search bar. After hitting enter and visiting that webpage, a prompt to download and launch the application will appear. Follow those on-screen prompts and enter the provided four digit Code. Please note, the four digit code will change on the screen, so be sure to check the code each time you connect. 
This is an example of the ""Present Using Wireless"" message on the TV/Projector
Changing Audio/Visual Devices
When connecting to the audio/visual devices in the conference room, it's important to pay close attention to the input/output connections on the device. The system should auto-detect those outputs, however there may be times it simply does not. In cases it doesn't, go to the settings on the device or application and ensure the ""receiver"" listed in the download/install prompt is the selected. 
Support
If there are issues connecting, using, or displaying any of the audio/visual systems in the conference room, scan or click the QR code below:"

Zoom, the video conferencing software supported by many school is a great way to stay connected remotely. However, many people are taking advantage of the increased Zoom traffic by hacking into meetings and ""Zoombombing."" Zoombombing, much like photobombing, is when someone makes their way into a Zoom meeting to which they were not invited. They then drop inappropriate or alarming content into the meeting, often through screen sharing.
 
In addition to creating a new meeting ID, you may want to create a password. Even if you use a new URL every meeting, a Zoombomber can still find the invite and hop in. Creating a password adds an extra layer of security to your meetings.

2. Click the Schedule a Meeting tab on the right side of the navigation bar on your Zoom home page.

On the desktop version, click the Schedule button in the center of the window.

3. Scroll down until you find the Meeting ID and Security sections.

4. If it is not already selected, change the Meeting ID to Generate Automatically. Then, check the box next to Passcode.

5. A password box will appear. You can either use the code given in the box, or you can create your own. This is the password your participants will use to get into the meeting.

6. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save.
7. Send the meeting link as well as the password in a private message or email to your participants.
By allowing only authenticated users to join, you can weed out anyone who isn't using their school email. Below is how to change the setting for a scheduled meeting.
1. Click the Schedule a Meeting tab and scroll down to the bottom of the page until you reach the Security section.

On the desktop version, click the Schedule button in the center of the window.

2. Under Security, check the boxes next to Waiting room and Require authentication to join.
3. In the drop down menu under Require authentication to join, select one of the following options

4. Click Save.
To make authentication a default setting for all your zoom meetings, follow the steps below.
1. Click on Zoom Settings located on the side bar, and then Meetings at the top.

2. Scroll down to Only authenticated users can join section and toggle it on.

3. Click on Edit next to Only BYUI Employees or Students

4. Check Set as default authentication option and click Save

 
1. Click the Schedule a Meeting tab and scroll down to the bottom of the page until you reach the Security section.

On the desktop version, click the Schedule button in the center of the window.

2. Under Security, check the box next to Waiting room.

 
This default setting allows anyone with access to the meeting to join before the host does. By turning off this feature, you lower the risk of someone joining and broadcasting content to all your meeting attendees without you there to kick out the Zoombomber. 
1. Go to Settings then Meeting.

2. Scroll down to Allow participants to join before host and ensure it is toggled off.

In the desktop version, this can be found under the Advanced Options tab in Schedule. Make sure Allow participants to join anytime is unchecked.

 
Screen share is a helpful tool that allows others in the meeting to see whatever is on your screen. However, if a Zoombomber is allowed to screen share in your meeting, they could show anything they want to your meeting. Disabling this feature will disable a lot of opportunities for Zoombombers.
You may still need to enable screen share as an option for yourself and your students for certain projects, assignments, or just overall better communication. In the Settings tab, you can configure the screen share settings so that only the host can screen share, and the host can control who else can screen share.
1. Click the Settings tab on the left side of the Zoom home window.

In the desktop version, click the gear icon at the top right corner of the window.

2. Under the Meetings tab, click In Meeting (Basic).

In the desktop version, click the View More Settings button at the bottom of the window. This will take you to the browser version of Zoom.  

3. Scroll to Screen sharing, make sure it is turned on with the toggle button, and select Host Only under Who can share?

 
If a Zoombomber does get into your meeting, there are ways to halt them in their tracks.
If there is anyone in your meeting who shouldn't be there, you have the power to make them leave.
1. Open the Participants List.

2. The list will slide out from the left of the screen. Hover over the participant's name and click the More drop-down menu. Click Remove.

3. Click Yes to confirm the removal.

If you don't want to kick them out, you can simply silence them by stopping their video and audio.
1. Open the Participants List.

2. The list will slide out from the left of the screen. Hover over the participant's name. Click Mute to turn off the participant's audio.

Follow these steps to sign into Zoom using the SSO option:
1. On the sign in page, click SSO.
2. It will ask for a company domain. Enter ""byui"" and click Continue.

3. You should get redirected to the BYUI sign in page where you can sign in using your BYUI credentials.

4. You now have successfully logged into Zoom using SSO.

When a user logs onto the BYU-Idaho VDI, they have access to a variety of programs. The user can work on homework, projects, or other documents. However, once the user logs off, all the documents created by the user will be erased.
There are several ways to save documents from the VDI:
If you are using the VDI client downloaded to your computer, you can save files to your computer's hard drive.
If you are using the VDI client downloaded to your computer, you do not need to log into OneDrive to save files to it. Instead, go to your computer's hard drive following the steps outlined above. Then select OneDrive and upload your files there.
If you are using the VDI though HTML in your browser, you will need to log into OneDrive in the VDI and upload your files to it from there.
Send an email to yourself with the file as an attachment.
You can also copy and paste the document from the VDI to your personal computer.
If you are using the client, you can copy and paste as normal.
 "
https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=11679,What is VDI (Virtual Desktop Interface)?,vdi log-off what-is-vdi how-does-vdi-work students-vdi vdi-class access-vdi save-files task-manager transfer-files play-music vdi-faq recover-lost-files-vdi vdi-cut-and-paste vdi-copy-and-paste vdi-lagging,"
A VDI is a virtual server with dozens of software programs, specifically for BYU-Idaho users. The term virtual in this context means ""to give the appearance of."" In this case, BYU-Idaho's Virtual Desktop Interface is designed to look and act exactly like a personal computer.
Once the user has logged in, they aren't controlling just their computer anymore, they are also giving commands to the virtual server. Even though this is a virtual server, it displays just like any other computer. The user can access any of the applications provided on the VDI.
If you don't have two monitors, you can move between the VDI screen and your personal computer screen by selecting the tabs on the top of the screen. For those who have two monitors, they will be able to see two different screens, as shown in the image below.
The left image is the BYU-Idaho Server. The right is the user's personal computer.

 
The VDI has several great uses. Firstly, the VDI is capable of handling big programs that a user's personal computer may not be able to handle, such as Adobe CC, Windows, and various engineering programs. For example, students who have to constantly come to campus to access software can access the same software anywhere in the world by accessing the VDI from a personal computer.
Secondly, the VDI is useful for users who are not able or do not want to download certain software onto their personal computer. Instead, they simply access the VDI to use the programs they need. This is especially useful for users who take classes that require the use of multiple types of obscure software on a frequent basis or for students who need access to a software they know will never use again.
For example, Mac users sometimes have a difficult time installing Windows. Instead of going through the process of downloading Windows onto their Mac, the user would access the VDI. From there, they can use Microsoft Office, Adobe, and other software needed for that semester's classes.
If there is a program/software a student needs for a specific class and the VDI does not have it, the student can contact their professor who can make a request to get the program/software added to VDI. Be aware that not all programs/software can be added to the VDI.
 
Closing the tab does not log the user off. The user stays logged in, which in some cases may cause the user to get locked out of their account when they try to log back in on a different WiFi. This can cause the student to not have access to their account. To avoid this inconvenience, the user must log off the correct way.
1. Click the Windows button in the bottom left hand corner.

2. Click the power button.

3. Click Shut down.

4. The Disconnected window will pop up if the shut down was successful.
Click Close.

 
When a user logs onto the BYU-Idaho VDI, they have access to a variety of programs. The user can work on homework, projects, or other documents. However, once the user logs off, all the documents created by the user will be erased.
There are three ways to save documents a user works on in the VDI:
2. Email the document to yourself.
3. Copy and paste the document from the VDI to your personal computer.
 
A user can open the Task Manager by right clicking the taskbar and then selecting ""Task Manager.""
Alternatively, it can be accessed by using ctrl+alt+delete when in the VDI. To use ctrl+alt+delete in VDI follow, the steps below.
1. Click the gray tab on the left hand side of the screen.

2. The left side panel will open.

3. Click the button with stacked boxes.

4. Click Task Manager.

5. The Task Manager will appear. Select the program you wish to shut down.

6. Click End Task.

Users can cut and paste documents from the VDI to their personal computer. In the client, copy and paste can be done using the usual ""ctrl+c"" and ""ctrl+v."" In the HTML however, you will need to follow the instructions below to cut and paste.
1. Click the gray tab on the left hand side of the screen.

2. The left side panel will open. Three little boxes will be clustered together. That will terminate an unresponsive application.

3. Click the Open Transfer File button.

4. The Transfer Files panel will open.

5. Find the file you want to transfer over. Right click and select Copy. This will send the copy to the Transfer Files window.

6. Click the download icon. This will download the file to your personal computer.

7. Click on the downloaded file. You have now copied and pasted a file from the VDI to your personal computer.

No. Every time you log off of the VDI, the system refreshes and all saved files are lost. To prevent this, see the section ""Saving files on a VDI.""
If the user is experiencing lagging when using the VDI, the number one reason for this happening is Wi-Fi. Check your connection to make sure it is working properly. Try going to a different location that has better Wi-Fi. BYU-Idaho campus provides some of the best Wi-Fi services for students.
Older computers may not handle it as well.

Yammer is BYU-Idaho's business social networking platform. With Yammer, you can easily collaborate with others, communicate quickly and thoroughly, and distribute files. There are even mobile apps for the Yammer platform!
One of the big shifts that has taken place in the way people communicate is via social networks. Social networks are becoming a major part of the way businesses work. Yammer is a mature enterprise social network specially designed to help employees stay connected with each other within a company. It has both free and standalone versions, but it gains much more functionality when enabled as part of all Office 365 subscriptions. Social networks inside the enterprise are not something to be feared; they are a new tool that will increase the productivity of all of us and make us feel much more engaged in our work.
Yammer provides a news feed section in the middle of its page where users can post updates and comment on existing posts. It also allows for users to use hashtags to highlight a certain point or use the @ symbol to mention other people in a post and notify them of your postings. Yammer supports the concepts of dedicated groups generally designed to be focused on a certain topic so it doesn't swamp the main feed or annoy those who are not interested in that topic. Access to these groups can be restricted.These groups serve as sub-groups to the overall company news feed.
 
Yammer allows you to: 
 
Yammer is very similar to Facebook in its look and feel. New posts - complete with Likes - appear on Yammer's primary screen, which is known as the News feed. Icons indicating private messages and other notifications appear in the upper left-hand corner. You can create groups, which is helpful for segregating talk that is relevant only to specific internal teams. If a group conversation eventually requires assistance from other employees, you can share it with a specific person via instant message or with a whole other group using the Update function.
 
Hashtags are very useful on Yammer because they help categorize your posts. Yammers robust search function digs up hashtagged posts quickly, so be sure to slap tags like #[currentyear]projections or #KeyCorporateAccount on the end of your posts for future searches.
 
The People Directory automatically creates a searchable database of every person enrolled in your Yammer, making it especially easy to find contact information for the people in your company. Even better, employee profiles come with a Skills section that makes it easier to search for them in the People Directory. You can also create external networks and invite non-employees (suppliers and clients, for instance) to join those networks.
 
Anyone can attach a file to a post in order to quickly share information without forcing recipients to slog through clogged inboxes. You can also upload files - including images and videos - to a file repository where other Yammer members can download and update them. Groups have their own separate file repositories (that augment the main one) that employees can receive automatic notifications for whenever critical files are updated.
 
Yammer has apps for iPhone, Android, and the Windows Phone. Compared to traditional email messaging, Yammer offers some unique benefits:

https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=13894,Zoho Assist: Remote Support Tool,screen-share-session zoho-assist zoho Remote-Assist Remote-Support zero-footprint,"We understand technical issues can be frustrating and difficult to resolve. We all love technology—it's great—until it stops working. This is why the IT Service Desk at BYU-Idaho offers solutions like Zoho Assist to get your issues solved quickly and conveniently, so you can get back to your studies, projects, and work without the frustration. In this article, we explain the what Zoho Assist is and why we use it to support you. We'll also do a brief dive into how we respect your privacy and security along the way. If you still have questions after reading this article, please don't hesitate to contact us! 
Zoho Assist is a private and secure remote support that allows our service desk analysts to instantly view and access your computer or device through screen-sharing in real-time. Whether you're facing a software glitch, seeing strange error codes, need help with an installation, or require guidance on using a particular service, Zoho Assist enables us to resolve your issues without the need for a physical visit. This feature is particularly helpful when supporting students with technical issues that live outside of the Rexburg area, especially our students who live overseas. 
When searching for a the right remote support tool, we found many benefits of using Zoho Assist: faster resolution, added convenience, greater access to expert assistance, and a ""Zero Footprint"" on your device. 
The tool allows for real-time screen sharing, making it easier for our technicians to diagnose and resolve issues promptly. This means less downtime for you and a more efficient use of your time. 
You don't have to disconnect your machine and bring it to a service center. Support is provided right where you are, making the entire process convenient and hassle-free.
Our technicians are well-trained and experienced, ensuring that you receive the highest quality of service. With Zoho Assist, they have a full suite of tools at their disposal to resolve your issues effectively.
The term ""Zero Footprint"" refers to the minimalistic approach Zoho Assist takes when it comes to installation and system resource utilization. Unlike traditional remote support tools that require a full-fledged installation, Zoho Assist operates largely through the browser or a small, temporary file. After your session is ended, Zoho Assist is immediately and automatically removed from your device. This means that there's no need to install bulky software, and no residual files are left on your system once the session is terminated.
Zoho's zero footprint model offers easy installation for both you and our technicians. The installation software is quick and lightweight. For technicians, this model simplifies the process of initiating a remote session. There's no need to guide our customers through a complex installation process; a simple link or code is often sufficient.

We understand that privacy and security are paramount. Zoho Assist employs industry-standard TLS 1.2 and AES 256-bit data encryption to ensure that all remote sessions are secure and safe. Any information collected during the remote support session is encrypted and protected from unauthorized users. All remote support connections require your consent before we can connect to your device. So you have complete control before, during, and after the remote session, in fact Zoho Assist allows you to terminate the screen-sharing session at anytime. 
Before initiating a remote session, our technicians will always seek your explicit consent. You'll be able to see all the actions performed during the session for full transparency.
Only authorized BYU-Idaho employees have access to your device and only during the session that you have approved. Each session requires a unique session ID (a secure code that an agent shares with you, that Zoho generates), which then expires at the end of the session, this gives our employees temporary access only to your device. In fact, once the remote support session ends, the software is automatically deleted off your device, through Zoho Assist's ""Zero Footprint"" protocol.

We've partnered with Microsoft Office 365's Exchange Online Protection (EOP) to automatically quarantine highly-suspicious messages at the server level before they even reach your Inbox or Junk E-mail folder. You will occasionally receive a message from quarantine@messaging.microsoft.com indicating that you have X (number) of new spam-quarantined messages. (see the instructions below to review messages even if you don't receive this email)
You will be given the following three options for each email:
This sends the message to your regular inbox. This is usually used to review the message in more detail to determine whether it's something that you want to continue to allow us to quarantine, whether you can safely unsubscribe from the message, or whether you want to report to us that it is not - in fact - junk.
This sends a copy of the message to the support team for analysis. If you're certain that the message should not have been quarantined - based on your review of the Sender and Subject from the report and/or from having used the ""Release to Inbox"" link to review it in more detail - this is how you'd let us know that you don't want these messages quarantined in the future.

This article contains information about common error messages in Microsoft Outlook, as well as tips to resolve the issue. Some errors and error messages you may encounter while using Microsoft Outlook include the following messages:
This error message typically deals with how an outgoing email message has been formatted. Check the To: field of the message first to ensure that the recipients address is correct.
 
First make sure that your computer still has an active network connection. To do this, click your computer’s wireless icon to see which Wi-Fi network – if any – it is connected to.
If you have verified that you are connected to a network and are still experiencing issues with Outlook, make sure that there are no permissions issues interrupting your ability to send emails.
Occasionally, a blocked firewall port or over-aggressive antivirus software can cause this error. Try unblocking the firewall port or scaling back your antivirus’s protections (at least temporarily). 
If you have fixed any problems with your connectivity, firewall, or antivirus and are still having problems, delete and recreate your Outlook profile.
 
If you are having difficulty sending and/or receiving emails from your BYU-Idaho account, it is probably because a pop-up blocker on your computer is preventing this from happening. How you can disable the pop-up blocker varies depending on your Internet browser.
1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Go to the Chrome menu and select Settings.

3. Select Show Advanced Settings at the bottom of the page.

Availability Only: This permission shows that you have an event at a particular time, but no further information. 
Limited Details: This permission will show the time, name, and location of the event. 
Full Details: This permission will show all information about all events on your calendar, except for any that you might have marked as Private. 
Editor: This permission allows delegates to read and create calendar items on your behalf, and to change and/or delete items they create. 
1. Select File on the Outlook desktop app menu.

2. Select Account Settings. 

3. Select Delegate Access. 

4. Choose the delegate you wish to change permissions for, then select Permissions....  

5. A box will pop up asking you what kind of permissions you want to give your delegate. Use this pop up to determine what permissions you wish to give the delegate. 

6. Select the check box next to Automatically send a message to delegate summarizing these permissions to send an email to your delegate informing them of their delegate status.

The image below is an example of a user's account information with two different emails appearing in their Outlook profile.

This does not mean there are two separate emails to keep track of.
As shown in the image above, a user's email is sometimes displayed as a BYU-Idaho email (smithj347@byui.edu) and a username@byui.edu email (johnsmith@byui.edu). Both email addresses are attached to the same profile. An email sent to smithj347@byui.edu will go to the same inbox as one sent to johnsmith@byui.edu.
 
When users input their email address, Microsoft is only looking for the BYU-Idaho domain name of ""@byui.edu"". This lets Microsoft know that a BYU-Idaho user is wanting to log into their school account.

Once the user inputs the email, Microsoft will then open the BYU-Idaho login page, as shown below. Users will then input their username and password to log in. This will take the user to their individual profile.

Ultimately, it does not matter which email to use. Microsoft is mainly looking for the BYU-Idaho domain name. But if you are still not sure, here are troubleshooting options that may help:
1. Read the prompt, they should tell you which one to use. Look for phrases like ""email address"" or ""username"".
2. Always try your school email first if instructions are not clear. Your school email is the abc18001@byui.edu email, not username@byui.edu.
3. Use your username@byui.edu if your school email does not work.
4. Microsoft should take you to the BYU-Idaho login page if you are not already logged into your BYU-Idaho account.
 
A username and an email have very similar functions. Both take you to your personal profile.
This can be similar to a person having both a name and a nickname. Benjamin could easily also be called Ben or Bennie. Each of those names are used to refer to the same person.
This is similar to a user's account at BYU-Idaho. Microsoft Outlook simply has two different emails attached to the same profile. Again, having two emails is nothing to be concerned about."

OneDrive for Business is the cloud storage platform provided by the University for all students and employees. This terabyte of digital storage space is intended for files pertaining to professional business and educational endeavors, such as employee documents, students' course files, and other personal university-related files (not personal files that do not pertain to one’s job). OneDrive for Business is linked to school accounts, so the files stored there are not accessible after termination or graduation.  
For this reason, employees and faculty are encouraged to use a OneDrive Personal account, Dropbox, or another cloud storage platform to store personal files. If you would like to subscribe to OneDrive Personal, sign in to OneDrive Online and select the diamond icon in the top right corner of the screen. This will direct you to the page where you can buy/subscribe to additional accounts. "

Phishing emails are a type of online scam where criminals impersonate legitimate organizations via email to try to steal your sensitive information. As part of the ongoing effort to protect students, faculty, and staff against phishing emails and other cyber attacks, BYU-Idaho has partnered with the Church Educational System Security Operations Center (CESSOC). The CESSOC has a breadth of experience mitigating cyber threats and currently protects several other Church-sponsored institutions.
This article explains the procedure for reporting potential phishing emails to the CESSOC. It is important that the suspect phishing email is attached as an email file instead of forwarded.
 
If you suspected that you have received a phishing email or other scam emails, keep all interactions with the email to a minimum. The best way to report these emails is to use the built-in ""Report"" Function of Microsoft Outlook. 
When you preview an email you can select the ""Report"" drop-down menu. Select the ""Report phishing"" option.

 
If for whatever reason this process does not work for you you can follow the following instructions based on your way of accessing your school email. You can send the phishing email, as an attachment, to phishing@byui.edu to report the phishing or scam email.
 
1. Sign into your BYUI account and open the Outlook webapp.

2. In your Outlook inbox, select New Message.

3. After the new message opens, select the Open in a new window button in the top right-hand corner of your new message.

4. After the new window opens, create a split screen between your email inbox and the new window so that both are visible. Address the new email to phishing@byui.edu

5. In your inbox, click and drag the suspect phishing email over to the body text field of your new message draft. 

6. You will see the phishing email appear as an attachment in the body of your new message draft.

7. Click Send. There is a Send button at the top and the bottom of the email draft, either one will work.

 
1. Open the Outlook Desktop App.
2. Select the suspect phishing email in your inbox.

3. Select More from the Respond section of the Home tab. This will open a drop-down menu with the option Forward as Attachment.

4. Select Forward as Attachment. This will open a new message draft in a new window with the suspicious email as an attachment.

5. Address the new message draft to phishing@byui.edu.

6. Click Send.

 
1. Open the Outlook Desktop App

2. Find the suspect phishing email and right click the email.

3. Select Forward As Attachment from the drop-down menu.

3. A new message draft window will open with the suspicious email attached. Address the email to phishing@byui.edu.

The BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi is intended primarily for ecclesiastical leaders serving on campus. This network allows bishops and stake presidents to process missionary applications and endorsements without the need to log into the campus network. In addition, this network may benefit other campus visitors like non-student dependents, parents of students, and various conference attendees. 
The BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi network is filtered like other campus networks, and the types of websites accessible from this network are more limited than the current BYU-Idaho Wi-Fi. For example, popular streaming sites such as Netflix and Hulu are blocked. More importantly, Canvas cannot be accessed on BYUI_Visitor Wi-Fi. Users attempting to access a blocked site may see either an “Application Blocked” page or the page simply will not load. Because of the restrictions that have been imposed on the BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi, students and employees will find the current BYU-Idaho Wi-Fi to be better suited to their needs. They should not view the Visitor Wi-Fi as a non-authenticated replacement or an alternative. "

Be wary when selecting a program, since some programs are actually viruses in disguise, designed to prey upon people's desire for antivirus protection.
NOTE: Google the product you are considering. If results such as “remove [product name] appear,” it is probably a questionable application.

While there are many kinds of antivirus software out there that are safe to use, here are some examples of safe software to look into:
Your computer is vulnerable when:  
Anything can happen in the world of technology. It is vital that you back up your files constantly in order to prevent the loss of important documents. You can back up your files by saving them in many different forms, including: "

Adware: Adware is among the most troublesome of computer threats. It can hide in places such as downloads for songs, movies, etc. Once installed on your computer, adware creates a flurry of advertisements and sends them directly to your computer. They can embed even more advertisements within the text of articles.
Direct Action: Direct action viruses begin their work as soon as they are installed on your computer. Typically, direct action viruses are designed to immediately activate/replicate when someone performs a specific action on a computer.
Directory: As its name would suggest, a directory virus attacks your computer by infiltrating its directory. (In computer terminology, a directory is just any big computer file that contains several smaller sub-files.) Typically, it will infect files with .EXE for PC's or .DMG for Mac extensions. Invisible to the user, a directory virus changes the host file so that the virus activates with the host file.
File Infector: File infectors are a classic virus; when someone refers to a generic virus, they are probably discussing these. These viruses spread from program to program by seeking out files to infect and then copying code into those files. Eventually, if left unchecked, file infectors can take over an entire system by compromising all of its files.
Hijacker: Hijacker viruses alter your Internet browser settings, typically in order to force your browser to redirect you to a page specified by the virus. These redirect pages are usually designed to advertise a product or drum up publicity for something/someone. They also alter the home page of your browser, spam you with unwanted advertisements, and block you from viewing Internet content.
Keylogger: Keyloggers place hidden software on your computer. This software keeps track of your keystrokes and takes note of the passwords you enter. Depending on what accounts you have, this can give hackers access to all kinds of private information.
Macro: Macro viruses contaminate individual programs on your computer. When a macro virus infects a program, it triggers a series of actions that will happen whenever someone runs the program.
Malware: Malware is any computer code that is designed to infiltrate a computer and damage it or its content.
Ransomware: One of the most devastating or alarming forms of an attack. Bad actors can literally steal the data belonging to you on your device, work or school account, and hold is ransom from you. Most times, the ransom must be paid in a form of money (gift cards, Venmo, or Paypal). Good cyber practices can protect you from ransomware. Most modern antivirus programs will offer you protection against ransomware. And these antivirus companies are spending time and energy to find ways to better protect against evolving ransomware attacks. 
Spam: The term ""spam"" refers to emails sent with the intent of advertising something or getting you to click a link. At their best, spam emails are simply nuisances that clutter your inbox, and they can be dealt with by dragging-and-dropping the message into the recycle bin. At their worst, they can promote illegal products/activities or conceal malware.
Spyware: Spyware is a form of malware that spies on your computer use. Spyware can take screen shots, capture data such as passwords and usernames, and collect other personal information. Keyloggers are just one example of spyware.
Trojan Horse: A Trojan horse is a virus that hides inside of something to make itself look enticing and appealing.
Virus: A virus is a type of malware that is designed to replicate and spread.
Worm: A worm is a form of virus that can copy itself and spread from computer to computer. It is not downloaded or attached to any one program; rather, it tunnels through computer networks in order to spread."

The ideal frequency for password-changing is every six months. When someone has your BYU-Idaho password, they have access to all your BYU-Idaho-associated records, including registration details, graduation progress, grades, email, and financial information. Some of this information can be destructive if it falls into the wrong hands.  
A quick and easy way to prevent information theft is to change your password frequently. This keeps potential thieves and criminals guessing, which keeps your information safe. However, while it’s smart to change your passwords frequently, do not change them too often. Changing passwords too frequently can result in weaker passwords that are easier for criminals to guess, which negates the security benefits offered by frequent password changes.

The Mac password management system is called the Keychain. This system stores all your passwords for applications, servers, and websites. Keychains can also remember sensitive information such as credit card numbers or PINs for bank accounts.  
While saving your BYU-Idaho password to your Apple Keychain is convenient, saving this information makes your account susceptible to hackers. It is recommended that you remove your password from the Keychain for your safety.

Hacking and password-cracking tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the more personal information we store in online accounts the more important it is to make sure our accounts are secure. The best place to start is with a strong password. 
Passwords should be a collection of 12 or more 
If your password is an ordinary word or name, a keyboard sequence, all letters, all lowercase, or fewer than 12 characters, you should change it to something stronger. Don't rely on tricky mixes of symbols, numbers, and uppercase letters alone. A mix of symbols, numbers, and uppercase letters makes a password stronger, but that alone wont make a simple password strong. For example, LetM3in isn't much better than just letmein when it comes to security.
To keep it simple, stick with a word or phrase you know and remember. Add symbols or numbers in place of letters where it might make sense to you, but not to others. The key here is to stay away from commonly used words or phrases, and to stay above 12 characters. Excellent passwords are long and complex, but easy to remember. Ideally, you are not using the same password for multiple websites, so you will want to remember your passwords and keep them straight. 
Strong passwords can also be created by stringing unrelated words together in a way that's memorable to you because it’s humorous (Inevitable culinary cat freedom, correct horse battery staple, etc.). While the entire phrase is long enough to be used as an effective password, a mix of numbers and symbols adds an extra layer of security. 
Check out this website to see how secure different kinds of passwords are. Just input a fake password and the website will tell you how long it will take hackers to crack your password. For best results try a different combination of letters, numbers, symbols, and length. You may be surprised at the results!

Mobile devices are everywhere. People use them for all kinds of things phone calls, texting, email, Web browsing, shopping, and more. Unfortunately, the rise in people using mobile devices for innocent purposes means there are now more people using them for criminal purposes.
Mobile worms work very similar to computer worms. Rather than being transferred via downloads or infected USB drives, mobile worms spread by “tunneling” from one phone to another using wireless networks. They usually bury themselves within text messages or voicemails. The purpose of these worms is to manipulate your phone in ways that hike up your phone bill. 
With the proper precautions you can protect yourself and your device. These precautions include: 
 
Vulnerable applications are apps which require your personal information to operate, but do not encrypt (secure) that information properly. This leaves a lot of potential for identity theft and other crimes.
 
Beside the immediate and obvious frustration of missing an important and expensive electronic, a lost or stolen phone or tablet can cause an enormous security risk. Depending on who falls into possession of the device, your information could be compromised. 
Prevention is better than a cure. Set a passcode on your phone. Locked phones are less attractive to thieves than unlocked ones. If your phone goes missing, the passcode will serve as an extra layer of protection for your information. Make sure your password is somewhat complicated, avoiding common codes like 1234 or 0000. 
If you suspect your phone or tablet has been lost or stolen:

Scammers often utilize social media by creating fake accounts pretending to be popular brands, organizations, celebrities, or even your own friends to try and convince you to give them personal information and data. They can use this information to steal your money, including credit or debit card numbers, bank account numbers, usernames and passwords, etc.
One common tactic that these accounts use is exploiting real giveaways. When a real account starts a giveaway, scammers will create fake accounts and seek out people who entered to try to get their personal information by telling them that they won.  
To identify fake accounts and avoid being scammed over social media, check the following criteria:

This article will help you with the common issues a printer might have.
Whenever you print directly from the Internet, the printing job results are not guaranteed to look as expected. Printing directly from the Internet can cause inconsistent results due to web developers using different methods to keep their pages updated. If these pages are not updated properly, it can cause documents to print blank or as a collection of random characters. If it is vital that your printed document looks the same as it does on the screen, it is highly recommended that you convert the document to a .pdf rather than attempt to print it directly from the Internet.
 
When you Open a document in the web browser rather than Save it to your computer, computer-to-printer issues often result. This is because the document may not register as fully downloaded, which can sometimes cause inconsistencies with the printer. These inconsistencies usually cause the printer to print blank pages. 
To resolve this issue, download the document in question and save it as a .pdf before printing.
 
If the jam is easily visible and can be removed quickly and effortlessly, feel free to remove the jammed paper yourself by taking hold of it and slowly pulling it from the printer.  
 
If your printer is printing documents too lightly, make sure that the printer you are using is stocked with the appropriate paper for your print job. You may have to locate a printer that can correctly print your job. 
 
Check your Pharos account. If the print job is still uploaded to Pharos, it may be an issue with Pharos not releasing it. If the print job released from Pharos but nothing printed, then it is likely an issue with the printer.
If it's likely an issue with the printer, try another printer on campus and let the I.T. Service Desk know that that printer is having issues.

Each email client (such as Outlook, Gmail, or Apple Mail) has their own name and system for creating ""Rules"". These Rules are automated instructions the system follows, which can do a number of things.
For example, you can send emails from a specific person directly to a folder instead of the inbox, send emails containing the subject ""BYU-Idaho"" to a specific folder, or even place any emails that contain the word ""cat"" into your funny cats folder. All you need is to create Outlook Rules.
Since there are many ways to create and use rules, this tutorial will go over one of the options. In this case, we will move all emails with the subject line ""BYU-Idaho"" to the folder ""BYU-Idaho News.""
1. Log in to your Outlook Email.
2. Click the Settings icon (gear icon) in the top right corner.

3. Click View all Outlook settings.

4. Click Rules.

5. If you haven't created any rules, your page should look like this:
6. Click + Add new rule.

7. Type in the name of the rule you want to make. In this case, type ""BYU-Idaho News.""

8. Add a condition. Conditions tell the computer what to look for. As you can see, there are many conditions you could set.
For this example, click Subject includes because we are only looking for emails containing ""BYU-Idaho"" in the subject line.

9. In the box to the right, fill in the phrase we are looking for. In this case, we are looking for ""BYU-Idaho"".

10. Select an action.
An action tells the computer what to do when a condition is met. But, as mentioned, there are dozens of options to choose from. You can make these Rules do practically anything.
In this case, select Move to because we are moving an email from the inbox to the BYU-Idaho News folder.

11. Select the folder you want to place the email in. Since you probably don't have this folder, scroll down to select New folder.

12. Type ""BYU-Idaho News"" in the New Folder box and click Enter.

13. Your page should now look like this:

14. If this option shows up (sometimes it doesn't), select Run rule now. Then, click Save.

15. You can turn a rule on and off whenever you like by selecting the Blue Toggle button to the left of the rule.

You're all done! Think of all the possibilities with your Rule tool!
Unfortunately, these neat tools can be used by hackers. Can you see now how someone may use these tools to create Rules that hide or steal important information from you? Remember to frequently check your rules for suspicious activity. If you didn't create a rule and you don't know what it does, it is probably a virus. Delete it immediately."

7. Select Apply rule on messages I receive and click Next.

8. Select with specific words in the subject. In the box below, it will explain what this condition is doing. Click the link specific words to select the name or group you wish to use. In this case, we will search for emails with the subject ""BYU-Idaho"".

9. Type the subject you want the computer to look for. In this case, type ""BYU-Idaho"". Click Add when done.

10. Click OK.

11. Select move it to the specified folder, since we want to move all emails with the subject ""BYU-Idaho"" to the folder, ""BYU-Idaho News"". Then click the link specified.
Keep in mind that there are a lot of actions to choose from. You can make this as personalized as you need.

12. If you have already created the folder ""BYU-Idaho News"", click the folder. If you have not, click New.

13. Type BYU-Idaho News in the box. Click OK.

14. The BYU-Idaho News folder should be highlighted. Click OK.

15. The name of the folder and what we are looking for in the subject line should show up in the lower box.
Since we have no other parameters, click Next.

16. If you would like to make any exceptions to this action, select the ones you want. For example, if you want all emails from Windy Weather sent to your folder, except the ones with the word ""tornadoes"", you can make those adjustments here. When you're done, click Next.

17. Don't forget to have Turn on this rule selected, to turn on the rule. If you want this rule to happen to mail already inside your inbox, select Run this rule now on messages already in ""Inbox"".
When you're done, click Finish.

If you created a new rule, and it is not functioning the way you wanted it to, here are a few suggestions.
1. Check to make sure the rule you made doesn't contain any mistakes like a misspelled word or incorrectly selected action.
2. Refresh your Outlook page.
3. Log out of Outlook and log back in again.
4. If you use the web-based Outlook (where it appears as a tab on whatever Internet browser you use), having the rule apply to messages already in your inbox does not work. After you have created the rule, any new mail that comes in will function properly. If the immediate functionality of the rule is important, download the desktop version of Outlook and take a look at your rules there. The desktop version of Outlook functions normally for messages already in the inbox."

Officially, emails that consist of more than 500 recipients per message cannot be sent or received through a BYU-Idaho email account. Additionally, the BYU-Idaho account limits emails to 10,000 recipients per day. Sending a lot of emails in a short period of time to a wide list of users may qualify you for being blocked.
Even though our stated limit is 500 recipients per message and 10,000 recipients per day, Microsoft has identified a limit that we do not share to avoid spammers. If spammers were to find the Microsoft limit, they would use it to stay within the lines of credulity to bypass our security. We advise pacing your sending to a longer period or investigating using mass mailing software such as the one that University Relations utilizes in order to get a better through-rate, in addition to better analytics.
 
Exceptions to this policy are intended only for explicitly-authorized senders. This includes the following: 
 
When sending approved mass emails from your BYU-Idaho account or to BYU-Idaho recipients (students, faculty, staff, and alumni), campus procedure strongly encourages that you use the ""bcc"" (Blind Carbon Copy) option.
 
""Bcc"" is the practice of sending an email to multiple recipients without disclosing the complete list of recipients.
You should ""Bcc"" when: 
1. When sending a new email message, select Cc.

2. In the pop-up window that appears, enter the email addresses of all recipients into the Bcc section at the bottom.

3. Once you have entered the desired email addresses, select OK.

4. Write the email and select Send.

If your Microsoft Office desktop apps are not syncing with your new password automatically, you may see a yellow bar near the top of the screen asking you to sign in, a yellow warning sign in the upper right-hand corner, or your document might say “Upload Blocked” after the title of the document on the top of the window.

There are several campus devices that require BYU-Idaho credentials in order to complete requests (e.g. printers, campus computers). Because these devices are directly linked to the University's system, their credential requirement should update automatically. Simply sign in with your updated password. 
In the event that your new password hasn't yet updated in the system, use the following process:
1. Make sure the device is connected to the BYUI Wi-Fi network. 
2. Log in using your previous password.
3. Restart the device.
4. Log in using your updated password.
 
Just as with internet browsers and password keychains, each password repository that includes your BYU-Idaho password will need to be manually updated. You can find instructions on how to update your password within your respective password repository's website. 
 
If you have saved your BYU-Idaho password to your internet browser, you will need to update it by visiting your browser's settings. Some browsers, like Chrome and Safari, will ask if you would like to update your settings after you log in with your updated password. Confirm that you would when this option appears.

After changing your BYU-Idaho password, you may have some difficulty connecting to the wireless network. Since your access to the university Wi-Fi is your BYU-Idaho credentials, your login information is technically no longer correct. You can easily fix this by updating your password in your device settings.  
The BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi is intended primarily for ecclesiastical leaders serving on campus. This network allows bishops and stake presidents to process missionary applications and endorsements without the need to log into the campus network. In addition, this network may benefit other campus visitors like non-student dependents, parents of students, and various conference attendees.  
The BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi network is filtered like other campus networks, and the types of websites accessible from this network are more limited than the current BYU-Idaho Wi-Fi. For example, popular streaming sites such as Netflix and Hulu are blocked. More importantly, Canvas cannot be accessed on BYUI_Visitor Wi-Fi. Users attempting to access a blocked site may see either an “Application Blocked” page or the page simply will not load. Because of the restrictions that have been imposed on the BYU-Idaho Visitor Wi-Fi, students and employees will find the current BYU-Idaho Wi-Fi to be better suited to their needs. They should not view the Visitor Wi-Fi as a non-authenticated replacement or an alternative.
